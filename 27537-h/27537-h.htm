<h3 class="chapter2">A Dinner and a Duel.</h3>


<p><span class="illodrop"><img src="images/i_chxi.png" width="125" height="123" alt="F" style="margin-top: -2.5em" /></span>rederick passed the whole of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span>
next day in brooding over his anger
and humiliation. He reproached
himself for not having given a
slap in the face to Cisy. As for
the Mar&eacute;chale, he swore not to
see her again. Others as good-looking could be
easily found; and, as money would be required in
order to possess these women, he would speculate on
the Bourse with the purchase-money of his farm. He
would get rich; he would crush the Mar&eacute;chale and
everyone else with his luxury. When the evening
had come, he was surprised at not having thought of
Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>"So much the better. What's the good of it?"</p>

<p>Two days after, at eight o'clock, Pellerin came to
pay him a visit. He began by expressing his admiration
of the furniture and talking in a wheedling
tone. Then, abruptly:</p>

<p>"You were at the races on Sunday?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, alas!"</p>

<p>Thereupon the painter decried the anatomy of
English horses, and praised the horses of Gericourt
and the horses of the Parthenon.</p>

<p>"Rosanette was with you?"</p>

<p>And he artfully proceeded to speak in flattering
terms about her.</p>

<p>Frederick's freezing manner put him a little out of
countenance.</p>

<p>He did not know how to bring about the question
of her portrait. His first idea had been to do a
portrait in the style of Titian. But gradually the
varied colouring of his model had bewitched him; he
had gone on boldly with the work, heaping up paste
on paste and light on light. Rosanette, in the beginning,
was enchanted. Her appointments with Delmar
had interrupted the sittings, and left Pellerin all
the time to get bedazzled. Then, as his admiration
began to subside, he asked himself whether the picture
might not be on a larger scale. He had gone
to have another look at the Titians, realised how the
great artist had filled in his portraits with such finish,
and saw wherein his own shortcomings lay; and
then he began to go over the outlines again in
the most simple fashion. After that, he sought, by
scraping them off, to lose there, to mingle there, all
the tones of the head and those of the background;
and the face had assumed consistency and the shades
vigour&mdash;the whole work had a look of greater firmness.
At length the Mar&eacute;chale came back again.
She even indulged in some hostile criticisms. The
painter naturally persevered in his own course. After
getting into a violent passion at her silliness, he said
to himself that, after all, perhaps she was right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Then began the era of doubts, twinges of reflection
which brought about cramps in the stomach, insomnia,
feverishness and disgust with himself. He had the
courage to make some retouchings, but without
much heart, and with a feeling that his work was bad.</p>

<p>He complained merely of having been refused a
place in the Salon; then he reproached Frederick for
not having come to see the Mar&eacute;chale's portrait.</p>

<p>"What do I care about the Mar&eacute;chale?"</p>

<p>Such an expression of unconcern emboldened the
artist.</p>

<p>"Would you believe that this brute has no interest
in the thing any longer?"</p>

<p>What he did not mention was that he had asked
her for a thousand crowns. Now the Mar&eacute;chale did
not give herself much bother about ascertaining who
was going to pay, and, preferring to screw money
out of Arnoux for things of a more urgent character,
had not even spoken to him on the subject.</p>

<p>"Well, and Arnoux?"</p>

<p>She had thrown it over on him. The ex-picture-dealer
wished to have nothing to do with the portrait.</p>

<p>"He maintains that it belongs to Rosanette."</p>

<p>"In fact, it is hers."</p>

<p>"How is that? 'Tis she that sent me to you,"
was Pellerin's answer.</p>

<p>If he had been thinking of the excellence of his
work, he would not have dreamed perhaps of making
capital out of it. But a sum&mdash;and a big sum&mdash;would
be an effective reply to the critics, and would
strengthen his own position. Finally, to get rid of
his importunities, Frederick courteously enquired his
terms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The extravagant figure named by Pellerin quite
took away his breath, and he replied:</p>

<p>"Oh! no&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"You, however, are her lover&mdash;'tis you gave me
the order!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I was only an intermediate agent."</p>

<p>"But I can't remain with this on my hands!"</p>

<p>The artist lost his temper.</p>

<p>"Ha! I didn't imagine you were so covetous!"</p>

<p>"Nor I that you were so stingy! I wish you good
morning!"</p>

<p>He had just gone out when S&eacute;n&eacute;cal made his appearance.</p>

<p>Frederick was moving about restlessly, in a state
of great agitation.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>S&eacute;n&eacute;cal told his story.</p>

<p>"On Saturday, at nine o'clock, Madame Arnoux
got a letter which summoned her back to Paris. As
there happened to be nobody in the place at the
time to go to Creil for a vehicle, she asked me to
go there myself. I refused, for this was no part of
my duties. She left, and came back on Sunday evening.
Yesterday morning, Arnoux came down to the
works. The girl from Bordeaux made a complaint to
him. I don't know what passed between them; but
he took off before everyone the fine I had imposed
on her. Some sharp words passed between us. In
short, he closed accounts with me, and here I am!"</p>

<p>Then, with a pause between every word:</p>

<p>"Furthermore, I am not sorry. I have done my
duty. No matter&mdash;you were the cause of it."</p>

<p>"How?" exclaimed Frederick, alarmed lest S&eacute;n&eacute;cal
might have guessed his secret.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>S&eacute;n&eacute;cal had not, however, guessed anything about
it, for he replied:</p>

<p>"That is to say, but for you I might have done
better."</p>

<p>Frederick was seized with a kind of remorse.</p>

<p>"In what way can I be of service to you now?"</p>

<p>S&eacute;n&eacute;cal wanted some employment, a situation.</p>

<p>"That is an easy thing for you to manage. You
know many people of good position, Monsieur Dambreuse
amongst others; at least, so Deslauriers told
me."</p>

<p>This allusion to Deslauriers was by no means
agreeable to his friend. He scarcely cared to call on
the Dambreuses again after his undesirable meeting
with them in the Champ de Mars.</p>

<p>"I am not on sufficiently intimate terms with them
to recommend anyone."</p>

<p>The democrat endured this refusal stoically, and
after a minute's silence:</p>

<p>"All this, I am sure, is due to the girl from Bordeaux,
and to your Madame Arnoux."</p>

<p>This "your" had the effect of wiping out of
Frederick's heart the slight modicum of regard he entertained
for S&eacute;n&eacute;cal. Nevertheless, he stretched out
his hand towards the key of his escritoire through
delicacy.</p>

<p>S&eacute;n&eacute;cal anticipated him:</p>

<p>"Thanks!"</p>

<p>Then, forgetting his own troubles, he talked about
the affairs of the nation, the crosses of the Legion of
Honour wasted at the Royal F&ecirc;te, the question of a
change of ministry, the Drouillard case and the B&eacute;nier
case&mdash;scandals of the day&mdash;declaimed against
the middle class, and predicted a revolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>His eyes were attracted by a Japanese dagger
hanging on the wall. He took hold of it; then he
flung it on the sofa with an air of disgust.</p>

<p>"Come, then! good-bye! I must go to N&ocirc;tre
Dame de Lorette."</p>

<p>"Hold on! Why?"</p>

<p>"The anniversary service for Godefroy Cavaignac
is taking place there to-day. He died at work&mdash;that
man! But all is not over. Who knows?"</p>

<p>And S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, with a show of fortitude, put out
his hand:</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall never see each other again!
good-bye!"</p>

<p>This "good-bye," repeated several times, his
knitted brows as he gazed at the dagger, his resignation,
and the solemnity of his manner, above all,
plunged Frederick into a thoughtful mood, but very
soon he ceased to think about S&eacute;n&eacute;cal.</p>

<p>During the same week, his notary at Havre sent him
the sum realised by the sale of his farm&mdash;one hundred
and seventy-four thousand francs. He divided it
into two portions, invested the first half in the Funds,
and brought the second half to a stock-broker to take
his chance of making money by it on the Bourse.</p>

<p>He dined at fashionable taverns, went to the theatres,
and was trying to amuse himself as best he
could, when Hussonnet addressed a letter to him announcing
in a gay fashion that the Mar&eacute;chale had got
rid of Cisy the very day after the races. Frederick
was delighted at this intelligence, without taking the
trouble to ascertain what the Bohemian's motive was
in giving him the information.</p>

<p>It so happened that he met Cisy, three days later.
That aristocratic young gentleman kept his counte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>ance,
and even invited Frederick to dine on the following
Wednesday.</p>

<p>On the morning of that day, the latter received a
notification from a process-server, in which M. Charles
Jean Baptiste Oudry apprised him that by the terms
of a legal judgment he had become the purchaser of
a property situated at Belleville, belonging to M.
Jacques Arnoux, and that he was ready to pay the
two hundred and twenty-three thousand for which it
had been sold. But, as it appeared by the same
decree that the amount of the mortgages with which
the estate was encumbered exceeded the purchase-money,
Frederick's claim would in consequence be
completely forfeited.</p>

<p>The entire mischief arose from not having renewed
the registration of the mortgage within the proper
time. Arnoux had undertaken to attend to this matter
formally himself, and had then forgotten all about
it. Frederick got into a rage with him for this, and
when the young man's anger had passed off:</p>

<p>"Well, afterwards&mdash;&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"If this can save him, so much the better. It
won't kill me! Let us think no more about it!"</p>

<p>But, while moving about his papers on the table,
he came across Hussonnet's letter, and noticed the
postscript, which had not at first attracted his attention.
The Bohemian wanted just five thousand francs
to give the journal a start.</p>

<p>"Ah! this fellow is worrying me to death!"</p>

<p>And he sent a curt answer, unceremoniously refusing
the application. After that, he dressed himself
to go to the Maison d'Or.</p>

<p>Cisy introduced his guests, beginning with the most
respectable of them, a big, white-haired gentleman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Marquis Gilbert des Aulnays, my godfather.
Monsieur Anselme de Forchambeaux," he said next&mdash;(a
thin, fair-haired young man, already bald); then,
pointing towards a simple-mannered man of forty:
"Joseph Boffreu, my cousin; and here is my old tutor,
Monsieur Vezou"&mdash;a person who seemed a mixture of
a ploughman and a seminarist, with large whiskers
and a long frock-coat fastened at the end by a single
button, so that it fell over his chest like a shawl.</p>

<p>Cisy was expecting some one else&mdash;the Baron de
Comaing, who "might perhaps come, but it was not
certain." He left the room every minute, and appeared
to be in a restless frame of mind. Finally, at
eight o'clock, they proceeded towards an apartment
splendidly lighted up and much more spacious than
the number of guests required. Cisy had selected it
for the special purpose of display.</p>

<p>A vermilion &eacute;pergne laden with flowers and fruit
occupied the centre of the table, which was covered
with silver dishes, after the old French fashion; glass
bowls full of salt meats and spices formed a border
all around it. Jars of iced red wine stood at regular
distances from each other. Five glasses of different
sizes were ranged before each plate, with things of
which the use could not be divined&mdash;a thousand
dinner utensils of an ingenious description. For the
first course alone, there was a sturgeon's jowl moistened
with champagne, a Yorkshire ham with tokay,
thrushes with sauce, roast quail, a b&eacute;chamel vol-au-vent,
a stew of red-legged partridges, and at the two
ends of all this, fringes of potatoes which were
mingled with truffles. The apartment was illuminated
by a lustre and some girandoles, and it was
hung with red damask curtains.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Four men-servants in black coats stood behind the
armchairs, which were upholstered in morocco. At
this sight the guests uttered an exclamation&mdash;the
tutor more emphatically than the rest.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, our host has indulged in a foolishly
lavish display of luxury. It is too beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said the Vicomte de Cisy; "Come
on, then!"</p>

<p>And, as they were swallowing the first spoonful:</p>

<p>"Well, my dear old friend Aulnays, have you
been to the Palais-Royal to see <i>P&egrave;re et Portier</i>?"</p>

<p>"You know well that I have no time to go!"
replied the Marquis.</p>

<p>His mornings were taken up with a course of
arboriculture, his evenings were spent at the Agricultural
Club, and all his afternoons were occupied by a
study of the implements of husbandry in manufactories.
As he resided at Saintonge for three fourths of
the year, he took advantage of his visits to the capital
to get fresh information; and his large-brimmed
hat, which lay on a side-table, was crammed with
pamphlets.</p>

<p>But Cisy, observing that M. de Forchambeaux refused
to take wine:</p>

<p>"Go on, damn it, drink! You're not in good
form for your last bachelor's meal!"</p>

<p>At this remark all bowed and congratulated him.</p>

<p>"And the young lady," said the tutor, "is charming,
I'm sure?"</p>

<p>"Faith, she is!" exclaimed Cisy. "No matter, he is
making a mistake; marriage is such a stupid thing!"</p>

<p>"You talk in a thoughtless fashion, my friend!"
returned M. des Aulnays, while tears began to gather
in his eyes at the recollection of his own dead wife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>And Forchambeaux repeated several times in succession:</p>

<p>"It will be your own case&mdash;it will be your own
case!"</p>

<p>Cisy protested. He preferred to enjoy himself&mdash;to
"live in the free-and-easy style of the Regency
days." He wanted to learn the shoe-trick, in order
to visit the thieves' taverns of the city, like Rodolphe
in the <i>Mysteries of Paris</i>; drew out of his pocket
a dirty clay pipe, abused the servants, and drank a
great quantity; then, in order to create a good impression
about himself, he disparaged all the dishes.
He even sent away the truffles; and the tutor, who
was exceedingly fond of them, said through servility;</p>

<p>"These are not as good as your grandmother's
snow-white eggs."</p>

<p>Then he began to chat with the person sitting
next to him, the agriculturist, who found many advantages
from his sojourn in the country, if it were
only to be able to bring up his daughters with simple
tastes. The tutor approved of his ideas and toadied
to him, supposing that this gentleman possessed influence
over his former pupil, whose man of business
he was anxious to become.</p>

<p>Frederick had come there filled with hostility to
Cisy; but the young aristocrat's idiocy had disarmed
him. However, as the other's gestures, face, and entire
person brought back to his recollection the dinner
at the Caf&eacute; Anglais, he got more and more irritated;
and he lent his ears to the complimentary remarks
made in a low tone by Joseph, the cousin, a fine
young fellow without any money, who was a lover
of the chase and a University prizeman. Cisy, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the sake of a laugh, called him a "catcher"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> several
times; then suddenly:</p>

<p>"Ha! here comes the Baron!"</p>

<p>At that moment, there entered a jovial blade of
thirty, with somewhat rough-looking features and
active limbs, wearing his hat over his ear and displaying
a flower in his button-hole. He was the
Vicomte's ideal. The young aristocrat was delighted
at having him there; and stimulated by his presence,
he even attempted a pun; for he said, as they passed
a heath-cock:</p>

<p>"There's the best of La Bruy&egrave;re's characters!"<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>After that, he put a heap of questions to M. de
Comaing about persons unknown to society; then, as
if an idea had suddenly seized him:</p>

<p>"Tell me, pray! have you thought about me?"</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>"You are not old enough, my little man. It is
impossible!"</p>

<p>Cisy had begged of the Baron to get him admitted
into his club. But the other having, no doubt, taken
pity on his vanity:</p>

<p>"Ha! I was forgetting! A thousand congratulations
on having won your bet, my dear fellow!"</p>

<p>"What bet?"</p>

<p>"The bet you made at the races to effect an entrance
the same evening into that lady's house."</p>

<p>Frederick felt as if he had got a lash with a whip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
He was speedily appeased by the look of utter confusion
in Cisy's face.</p>

<p>In fact, the Mar&eacute;chale, next morning, was filled
with regret when Arnoux, her first lover, her good
friend, had presented himself that very day. They
both gave the Vicomte to understand that he was
in the way, and kicked him out without much ceremony.</p>

<p>He pretended not to have heard what was said.</p>

<p>The Baron went on:</p>

<p>"What has become of her, this fine Rose? Is
she as pretty as ever?" showing by his manner that
he had been on terms of intimacy with her.</p>

<p>Frederick was chagrined by the discovery.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to blush at," said the Baron,
pursuing the topic, "'tis a good thing!"</p>

<p>Cisy smacked his tongue.</p>

<p>"Whew! not so good!"</p>

<p>"Ha!"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, yes! In the first place, I found her
nothing extraordinary, and then, you pick up the
like of her as often as you please, for, in fact, she is
for sale!"</p>

<p>"Not for everyone!" remarked Frederick, with
some bitterness.</p>

<p>"He imagines that he is different from the
others," was Cisy's comment. "What a good joke!"</p>

<p>And a laugh ran round the table.</p>

<p>Frederick felt as if the palpitations of his heart
would suffocate him. He swallowed two glasses of
water one after the other.</p>

<p>But the Baron had preserved a lively recollection
of Rosanette.</p>

<p>"Is she still interested in a fellow named Arnoux?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't the faintest idea," said Cisy, "I don't
know that gentleman!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he suggested that he believed Arnoux
was a sort of swindler.</p>

<p>"A moment!" exclaimed Frederick.</p>

<p>"However, there is no doubt about it! Legal
proceedings have been taken against him."</p>

<p>"That is not true!"</p>

<p>Frederick began to defend Arnoux, vouched for
his honesty, ended by convincing himself of it, and
concocted figures and proofs. The Vicomte, full of
spite, and tipsy in addition, persisted in his assertions,
so that Frederick said to him gravely:</p>

<p>"Is the object of this to give offence to me, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>And he looked Cisy full in the face, with eyeballs
as red as his cigar.</p>

<p>"Oh! not at all. I grant you that he possesses
something very nice&mdash;his wife."</p>

<p>"Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"Faith, I do! Sophie Arnoux; everyone knows her."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me that?"</p>

<p>Cisy, who had staggered to his feet, hiccoughed:</p>

<p>"Everyone&mdash;knows&mdash;her."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue. It is not with women of her
sort you keep company!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;flatter myself&mdash;it is."</p>

<p>Frederick flung a plate at his face. It passed like
a flash of lightning over the table, knocked down
two bottles, demolished a fruit-dish, and breaking
into three pieces, by knocking against the &eacute;pergne,
hit the Vicomte in the stomach.</p>

<p>All the other guests arose to hold him back. He
struggled and shrieked, possessed by a kind of frenzy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>M. des Aulnays kept repeating:</p>

<p>"Come, be calm, my dear boy!"</p>

<p>"Why, this is frightful!" shouted the tutor.</p>

<p>Forchambeaux, livid as a plum, was trembling.
Joseph indulged in repeated outbursts of laughter.
The attendants sponged out the traces of the wine,
and gathered up the remains of the dinner from the
floor; and the Baron went and shut the window, for
the uproar, in spite of the noise of carriage-wheels,
could be heard on the boulevard.</p>

<p>As all present at the moment the plate had been
flung had been talking at the same time, it was impossible
to discover the cause of the attack&mdash;whether
it was on account of Arnoux, Madame Arnoux, Rosanette,
or somebody else. One thing only they were
certain of, that Frederick had acted with indescribable
brutality. On his part, he refused positively to
testify the slightest regret for what he had done.</p>

<p>M. des Aulnays tried to soften him. Cousin Joseph,
the tutor, and Forchambeaux himself joined in
the effort. The Baron, all this time, was cheering up
Cisy, who, yielding to nervous weakness, began to
shed tears.</p>

<p>Frederick, on the contrary, was getting more and
more angry, and they would have remained there till
daybreak if the Baron had not said, in order to bring
matters to a close:</p>

<p>"The Vicomte, Monsieur, will send his seconds
to call on you to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Your hour?"</p>

<p>"Twelve, if it suits you."</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Monsieur."</p>

<p>Frederick, as soon as he was in the open air,
drew a deep breath. He had been keeping his feel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>ings
too long under restraint; he had satisfied them
at last. He felt, so to speak, the pride of virility, a
superabundance of energy within him which intoxicated
him. He required two seconds. The first person
he thought of for the purpose was Regimbart,
and he immediately directed his steps towards the
Rue Saint-Denis. The shop-front was closed, but
some light shone through a pane of glass over the
door. It opened and he went in, stooping very low
as he passed under the penthouse.</p>

<p>A candle at the side of the bar lighted up the deserted
smoking-room. All the stools, with their feet
in the air, were piled on the table. The master and
mistress, with their waiter, were at supper in a corner
near the kitchen; and Regimbart, with his hat on
his head, was sharing their meal, and even disturbed
the waiter, who was compelled every moment to turn
aside a little. Frederick, having briefly explained the
matter to him, asked Regimbart to assist him. The
Citizen at first made no reply. He rolled his eyes
about, looked as if he were plunged in reflection,
took several strides around the room, and at last
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, by all means!" and a homicidal smile
smoothed his brow when he learned that the adversary
was a nobleman.</p>

<p>"Make your mind easy; we'll rout him with flying
colours! In the first place, with the sword&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But perhaps," broke in Frederick, "I have not
the right."</p>

<p>"I tell you 'tis necessary to take the sword," the
Citizen replied roughly. "Do you know how to
make passes?"</p>

<p>"A little."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! a little. This is the way with all of them;
and yet they have a mania for committing assaults.
What does the fencing-school teach? Listen to me:
keep a good distance off, always confining yourself
in circles, and parry&mdash;parry as you retire; that is
permitted. Tire him out. Then boldly make a lunge
on him! and, above all, no malice, no strokes of the
La Foug&egrave;re kind.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> No! a simple one-two, and some
disengagements. Look here! do you see? while you
turn your wrist as if opening a lock. P&egrave;re Vauthier,
give me your cane. Ha! that will do."</p>

<p>He grasped the rod which was used for lighting
the gas, rounded his left arm, bent his right, and began
to make some thrusts against the partition. He
stamped with his foot, got animated, and pretended
to be encountering difficulties, while he exclaimed:
"Are you there? Is that it? Are you there?" and
his enormous silhouette projected itself on the wall
with his hat apparently touching the ceiling. The
owner of the caf&eacute; shouted from time to time:
"Bravo! very good!" His wife, though a little unnerved,
was likewise filled with admiration; and
Th&eacute;odore, who had been in the army, remained riveted
to the spot with amazement, the fact being,
however, that he regarded M. Regimbart with a
species of hero-worship.</p>

<p>Next morning, at an early hour, Frederick hurried
to the establishment in which Dussardier was employed.
After having passed through a succession of
departments all full of clothing-materials, either adorn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>ing
shelves or lying on tables, while here and there
shawls were fixed on wooden racks shaped like toadstools,
he saw the young man, in a sort of railed
cage, surrounded by account-books, and standing in
front of a desk at which he was writing. The
honest fellow left his work.</p>

<p>The seconds arrived before twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>Frederick, as a matter of good taste, thought he
ought not to be present at the conference.</p>

<p>The Baron and M. Joseph declared that they
would be satisfied with the simplest excuses. But
Regimbart's principle being never to yield, and his
contention being that Arnoux's honour should be
vindicated (Frederick had not spoken to him about
anything else), he asked that the Vicomte should apologise.
M. de Comaing was indignant at this presumption.
The Citizen would not abate an inch.
As all conciliation proved impracticable, there was
nothing for it but to fight.</p>

<p>Other difficulties arose, for the choice of weapons
lay with Cisy, as the person to whom the insult had
been offered. But Regimbart maintained that by
sending the challenge he had constituted himself the
offending party. His seconds loudly protested that a
buffet was the most cruel of offences. The Citizen
carped at the words, pointing out that a buffet was
not a blow. Finally, they decided to refer the matter
to a military man; and the four seconds went off
to consult the officers in some of the barracks.</p>

<p>They drew up at the barracks on the Quai d'Orsay.
M. de Comaing, having accosted two captains, explained
to them the question in dispute.</p>

<p>The captains did not understand a word of what
he was saying, owing to the confusion caused by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Citizen's incidental remarks. In short, they advised
the gentlemen who consulted them to draw up a
minute of the proceedings; after which they would
give their decision. Thereupon, they repaired to a
caf&eacute;; and they even, in order to do things with more
circumspection, referred to Cisy as H, and Frederick
as K.</p>

<p>Then they returned to the barracks. The officers
had gone out. They reappeared, and declared that
the choice of arms manifestly belonged to H.</p>

<p>They all returned to Cisy's abode. Regimbart and
Dussardier remained on the footpath outside.</p>

<p>The Vicomte, when he was informed of the solution
of the case, was seized with such extreme agitation
that they had to repeat for him several times
the decision of the officers; and, when M. de Comaing
came to deal with Regimbart's contention, he
murmured "Nevertheless," not being very reluctant
himself to yield to it. Then he let himself sink into
an armchair, and declared that he would not fight.</p>

<p>"Eh? What?" said the Baron. Then Cisy indulged
in a confused flood of mouthings. He wished
to fight with firearms&mdash;to discharge a single pistol
at close quarters.</p>

<p>"Or else we will put arsenic into a glass, and
draw lots to see who must drink it. That's sometimes
done. I've read of it!"</p>

<p>The Baron, naturally rather impatient, addressed
him in a harsh tone:</p>

<p>"These gentlemen are waiting for your answer.
This is indecent, to put it shortly. What weapons
are you going to take? Come! is it the sword?"</p>

<p>The Vicomte gave an affirmative reply by merely
nodding his head; and it was arranged that the meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>ing
should take place next morning at seven o'clock
sharp at the Maillot gate.</p>

<p>Dussardier, being compelled to go back to his
business, Regimbart went to inform Frederick about
the arrangement. He had been left all day without
any news, and his impatience was becoming intolerable.</p>

<p>"So much the better!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The Citizen was satisfied with his deportment.</p>

<p>"Would you believe it? They wanted an apology
from us. It was nothing&mdash;a mere word! But I
knocked them off their beam-ends nicely. The right
thing to do, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," said Frederick, thinking that it
would have been better to choose another second.</p>

<p>Then, when he was alone, he repeated several
times in a very loud tone:</p>

<p>"I am going to fight! Hold on, I am going to
fight! 'Tis funny!"</p>

<p>And, as he walked up and down his room, while
passing in front of the mirror, he noticed that he
was pale.</p>

<p>"Have I any reason to be afraid?"</p>

<p>He was seized with a feeling of intolerable misery
at the prospect of exhibiting fear on the ground.</p>

<p>"And yet, suppose I happen to be killed? My
father met his death the same way. Yes, I shall be
killed!"</p>

<p>And, suddenly, his mother rose up before him in
a black dress; incoherent images floated before his
mind. His own cowardice exasperated him. A paroxysm
of courage, a thirst for human blood, took
possession of him. A battalion could not have made
him retreat. When this feverish excitement had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
cooled down, he was overjoyed to feel that his
nerves were perfectly steady. In order to divert his
thoughts, he went to the opera, where a ballet was
being performed. He listened to the music, looked
at the <i>danseuses</i> through his opera-glass, and drank
a glass of punch between the acts. But when he
got home again, the sight of his study, of his furniture,
in the midst of which he found himself for the last
time, made him feel ready to swoon.</p>

<p>He went down to the garden. The stars were
shining; he gazed up at them. The idea of fighting
about a woman gave him a greater importance in his
own eyes, and surrounded him with a halo of nobility.
Then he went to bed in a tranquil frame of
mind.</p>

<p>It was not so with Cisy. After the Baron's departure,
Joseph had tried to revive his drooping
spirits, and, as the Vicomte remained in the same
dull mood:</p>

<p>"However, old boy, if you prefer to remain at
home, I'll go and say so."</p>

<p>Cisy durst not answer "Certainly;" but he would
have liked his cousin to do him this service without
speaking about it.</p>

<p>He wished that Frederick would die during the
night of an attack of apoplexy, or that a riot would
break out so that next morning there would be
enough of barricades to shut up all the approaches
to the Bois de Boulogne, or that some emergency
might prevent one of the seconds from being present;
for in the absence of seconds the duel would fall
through. He felt a longing to save himself by taking
an express train&mdash;no matter where. He regretted
that he did not understand medicine so as to be able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to take something which, without endangering his
life, would cause it to be believed that he was dead.
He finally wished to be ill in earnest.</p>

<p>In order to get advice and assistance from someone,
he sent for M. des Aulnays. That worthy man
had gone back to Saintonge on receiving a letter informing
him of the illness of one of his daughters.
This appeared an ominous circumstance to Cisy.
Luckily, M. Vezou, his tutor, came to see him.
Then he unbosomed himself.</p>

<p>"What am I to do? my God! what am I do?"</p>

<p>"If I were in your place, Monsieur, I should
pay some strapping fellow from the market-place to
go and give him a drubbing."</p>

<p>"He would still know who brought it about," replied
Cisy.</p>

<p>And from time to time he uttered a groan; then:</p>

<p>"But is a man bound to fight a duel?"</p>

<p>"'Tis a relic of barbarism! What are you to do?"</p>

<p>Out of complaisance the pedagogue invited himself
to dinner. His pupil did not eat anything, but,
after the meal, felt the necessity of taking a short
walk.</p>

<p>As they were passing a church, he said:</p>

<p>"Suppose we go in for a little while&mdash;to look?"</p>

<p>M. Vezou asked nothing better, and even offered
him holy water.</p>

<p>It was the month of May. The altar was covered
with flowers; voices were chanting; the organ was
resounding through the church. But he found it impossible
to pray, as the pomps of religion inspired
him merely with thoughts of funerals. He fancied
that he could hear the murmurs of the <i>De Profundis</i>.</p>

<p>"Let us go away. I don't feel well."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>They spent the whole night playing cards. The
Vicomte made an effort to lose in order to exorcise
ill-luck, a thing which M. Vezou turned to his own
advantage. At last, at the first streak of dawn, Cisy,
who could stand it no longer, sank down on the
green cloth, and was soon plunged in sleep, which
was disturbed by unpleasant dreams.</p>

<p>If courage, however, consists in wishing to get
the better of one's own weakness, the Vicomte was
courageous, for in the presence of his seconds, who
came to seek him, he stiffened himself up with all
the strength he could command, vanity making him
realise that to attempt to draw back now would destroy
him. M. de Comaing congratulated him on his
good appearance.</p>

<p>But, on the way, the jolting of the cab and the
heat of the morning sun made him languish. His
energy gave way again. He could not even distinguish
any longer where they were. The Baron
amused himself by increasing his terror, talking about
the "corpse," and of the way they meant to get
back clandestinely to the city. Joseph gave the rejoinder;
both, considering the affair ridiculous, were
certain that it would be settled.</p>

<p>Cisy kept his head on his breast; he lifted it up
slowly, and drew attention to the fact that they had
not taken a doctor with them.</p>

<p>"'Tis needless," said the Baron.</p>

<p>"Then there's no danger?"</p>

<p>Joseph answered in a grave tone:</p>

<p>"Let us hope so!"</p>

<p>And nobody in the carriage made any further remark.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past seven they arrived in front of
the Maillot gate. Frederick and his seconds were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
there, the entire group being dressed all in black.
Regimbart, instead of a cravat, wore a stiff horsehair
collar, like a trooper; and he carried a long violin-case
adapted for adventures of this kind. They exchanged
frigid bows. Then they all plunged into the Bois de
Boulogne, taking the Madrid road, in order to find a
suitable place.</p>

<p>Regimbart said to Frederick, who was walking between
him and Dussardier:</p>

<p>"Well, and this scare&mdash;what do we care about
it? If you want anything, don't annoy yourself about
it; I know what to do. Fear is natural to man!"</p>

<p>Then, in a low tone:</p>

<p>"Don't smoke any more; in this case it has a
weakening effect."</p>

<p>Frederick threw away his cigar, which had only a
disturbing effect on his brain, and went on with a
firm step. The Vicomte advanced behind, leaning on
the arms of his two seconds. Occasional wayfarers
crossed their path. The sky was blue, and from
time to time they heard rabbits skipping about. At
the turn of a path, a woman in a Madras neckerchief
was chatting with a man in a blouse; and in the
large avenue under the chestnut-trees some grooms in
vests of linen-cloth were walking horses up and down.</p>

<p>Cisy recalled the happy days when, mounted on
his own chestnut horse, and with his glass stuck in
his eye, he rode up to carriage-doors. These recollections
intensified his wretchedness. An intolerable
thirst parched his throat. The buzzing of flies
mingled with the throbbing of his arteries. His feet
sank into the sand. It seemed to him as if he had
been walking during a period which had neither beginning
nor end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The seconds, without stopping, examined with
keen glances each side of the path they were traversing.
They hesitated as to whether they would go to
the Catelan Cross or under the walls of the Bagatelle.
At last they took a turn to the right; and they drew
up in a kind of quincunx in the midst of the pine-trees.</p>

<p>The spot was chosen in such a way that the level
ground was cut equally into two divisions. The two
places at which the principals in the duel were to
take their stand were marked out. Then Regimbart
opened his case. It was lined with red sheep's-leather,
and contained four charming swords hollowed
in the centre, with handles which were adorned with
filigree. A ray of light, passing through the leaves,
fell on them, and they appeared to Cisy to glitter
like silver vipers on a sea of blood.</p>

<p>The Citizen showed that they were of equal length.
He took one himself, in order to separate the combatants
in case of necessity. M. de Comaing held
a walking-stick. There was an interval of silence.
They looked at each other. All the faces had in them
something fierce or cruel.</p>

<p>Frederick had taken off his coat and his waistcoat.
Joseph aided Cisy to do the same. When his cravat
was removed a blessed medal could be seen on
his neck. This made Regimbart smile contemptuously.</p>

<p>Then M. de Comaing (in order to allow Frederick
another moment for reflection) tried to raise some
quibbles. He demanded the right to put on a glove,
and to catch hold of his adversary's sword with the
left hand. Regimbart, who was in a hurry, made no
objection to this. At last the Baron, addressing Frederick:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything depends on you, Monsieur! There is
never any dishonour in acknowledging one's faults."</p>

<p>Dussardier made a gesture of approval. The Citizen
gave vent to his indignation:</p>

<p>"Do you think we came here as a mere sham,
damn it! Be on your guard, each of you!"</p>

<p>The combatants were facing one another, with
their seconds by their sides.</p>

<p>He uttered the single word:</p>

<p>"Come!"</p>

<p>Cisy became dreadfully pale. The end of his
blade was quivering like a horsewhip. His head fell
back, his hands dropped down helplessly, and he
sank unconscious on the ground. Joseph raised him
up and while holding a scent-bottle to his nose, gave
him a good shaking.</p>

<p>The Vicomte reopened his eyes, then suddenly
grasped at his sword like a madman. Frederick had
held his in readiness, and now awaited him with
steady eye and uplifted hand.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!" cried a voice, which came from
the road simultaneously with the sound of a horse at
full gallop, and the hood of a cab broke the branches.
A man bending out his head waved a handkerchief,
still exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Stop! stop!"</p>

<p>M. de Comaing, believing that this meant the intervention
of the police, lifted up his walking-stick.</p>

<p>"Make an end of it. The Vicomte is bleeding!"</p>

<p>"I?" said Cisy.</p>

<p>In fact, he had in his fall taken off the skin of his
left thumb.</p>

<p>"But this was by falling," observed the Citizen.</p>

<p>The Baron pretended not to understand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Arnoux had jumped out of the cab.</p>

<p>"I have arrived too late? No! Thanks be to
God!"</p>

<p>He threw his arms around Frederick, felt him, and
covered his face with kisses.</p>

<p>"I am the cause of it. You wanted to defend your
old friend! That's right&mdash;that's right! Never shall I
forget it! How good you are! Ah! my own dear boy!"</p>

<p>He gazed at Frederick and shed tears, while he
chuckled with delight. The Baron turned towards
Joseph:</p>

<p>"I believe we are in the way at this little family
party. It is over, messieurs, is it not? Vicomte, put
your arm into a sling. Hold on! here is my silk
handkerchief."</p>

<p>Then, with an imperious gesture: "Come! no
spite! This is as it should be!"</p>

<p>The two adversaries shook hands in a very lukewarm
fashion. The Vicomte, M. de Comaing, and
Joseph disappeared in one direction, and Frederick left
with his friends in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>As the Madrid Restaurant was not far off, Arnoux
proposed that they should go and drink a glass of
beer there.</p>

<p>"We might even have breakfast."</p>

<p>But, as Dussardier had no time to lose, they
confined themselves to taking some refreshment in
the garden.</p>

<p>They all experienced that sense of satisfaction
which follows happy <i>d&eacute;nouements</i>. The Citizen,
nevertheless, was annoyed at the duel having been
interrupted at the most critical stage.</p>

<p>Arnoux had been apprised of it by a person named
Compain, a friend of Regimbart; and with an irre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>pressible
outburst of emotion he had rushed to the
spot to prevent it, under the impression, however,
that he was the occasion of it. He begged of Frederick
to furnish him with some details about it. Frederick,
touched by these proofs of affection, felt some scruples
at the idea of increasing his misapprehension of the
facts.</p>

<p>"For mercy's sake, don't say any more about it!"</p>

<p>Arnoux thought that this reserve showed great
delicacy. Then, with his habitual levity, he passed
on to some fresh subject.</p>

<p>"What news, Citizen?"</p>

<p>And they began talking about banking transactions,
and the number of bills that were falling due. In
order to be more undisturbed, they went to another
table, where they exchanged whispered confidences.</p>

<p>Frederick could overhear the following words:
"You are going to back me up with your signature."
"Yes, but you, mind!" "I have negotiated
it at last for three hundred!" "A nice commission,
faith!"</p>

<p>In short, it was clear that Arnoux was mixed up
in a great many shady transactions with the Citizen.</p>

<p>Frederick thought of reminding him about the fifteen
thousand francs. But his last step forbade the utterance
of any reproachful words even of the mildest
description. Besides, he felt tired himself, and this
was not a convenient place for talking about such a
thing. He put it off till some future day.</p>

<p>Arnoux, seated in the shade of an evergreen, was
smoking, with a look of joviality in his face. He
raised his eyes towards the doors of private rooms
looking out on the garden, and said he had often paid
visits to the house in former days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Probably not by yourself?" returned the Citizen.</p>

<p>"Faith, you're right there!"</p>

<p>"What blackguardism you do carry on! you, a
married man!"</p>

<p>"Well, and what about yourself?" retorted Arnoux;
and, with an indulgent smile: "I am even
sure that this rascal here has a room of his own
somewhere into which he takes his friends."</p>

<p>The Citizen confessed that this was true by simply
shrugging his shoulders. Then these two gentlemen
entered into their respective tastes with regard to the
sex: Arnoux now preferred youth, work-girls; Regimbart
hated affected women, and went in for the genuine
article before anything else. The conclusion
which the earthenware-dealer laid down at the close of
this discussion was that women were not to be taken
seriously.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, he is fond of his own wife,"
thought Frederick, as he made his way home; and he
looked on Arnoux as a coarse-grained man. He had
a grudge against him on account of the duel, as if it
had been for the sake of this individual that he risked
his life a little while before.</p>

<p>But he felt grateful to Dussardier for his devotedness.
Ere long the book-keeper came at his invitation
to pay him a visit every day.</p>

<p>Frederick lent him books&mdash;Thiers, Dulaure, Barante,
and Lamartine's <i>Girondins</i>.</p>

<p>The honest fellow listened to everything the other
said with a thoughtful air, and accepted his opinions
as those of a master.</p>

<p>One evening he arrived looking quite scared.</p>

<p>That morning, on the boulevard, a man who was
running so quickly that he had got out of breath, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
jostled against him, and having recognised in him a
friend of S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, had said to him:</p>

<p>"He has just been taken! I am making my
escape!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. Dussardier had
spent the day making enquiries. S&eacute;n&eacute;cal was in jail
charged with an attempted crime of a political nature.</p>

<p>The son of an overseer, he was born at Lyons,
and having had as his teacher a former disciple of
Chalier, he had, on his arrival in Paris, obtained admission
into the "Society of Families." His ways
were known, and the police kept a watch on him.
He was one of those who fought in the outbreak of
May, 1839, and since then he had remained in the
shade; but, his self-importance increasing more and
more, he became a fanatical follower of Alibaud, mixing
up his own grievances against society with those
of the people against monarchy, and waking up every
morning in the hope of a revolution which in a fortnight
or a month would turn the world upside down.
At last, disgusted at the inactivity of his brethren,
enraged at the obstacles that retarded the realisation
of his dreams, and despairing of the country, he
entered in his capacity of chemist into the conspiracy
for the use of incendiary bombs; and he had been
caught carrying gunpowder, of which he was going
to make a trial at Montmartre&mdash;a supreme effort to
establish the Republic.</p>

<p>Dussardier was no less attached to the Republican
idea, for, from his point of view, it meant enfranchisement
and universal happiness. One day&mdash;at the
age of fifteen&mdash;in the Rue Transnonain, in front of a
grocer's shop, he had seen soldiers' bayonets reddened
with blood and exhibiting human hairs pasted to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
butt-ends of their guns. Since that time, the Government
had filled him with feelings of rage as the
very incarnation of injustice. He frequently confused
the assassins with the gendarmes; and in his eyes a
police-spy was just as bad as a parricide. All the
evil scattered over the earth he ingenuously attributed
to Power; and he hated it with a deep-rooted, undying
hatred that held possession of his heart and made
his sensibility all the more acute. He had been dazzled
by S&eacute;n&eacute;cal's declamations. It was of little consequence
whether he happened to be guilty or not, or
whether the attempt with which he was charged
could be characterised as an odious proceeding! Since
he was the victim of Authority, it was only right to
help him.</p>

<p>"The Peers will condemn him, certainly! Then
he will be conveyed in a prison-van, like a convict,
and will be shut up in Mont Saint-Michel, where
the Government lets people die! Austen had gone
mad! Steuben had killed himself! In order to transfer
Barb&egrave;s into a dungeon, they had dragged him by
the legs and by the hair. They trampled on his
body, and his head rebounded along the staircase at
every step they took. What abominable treatment!
The wretches!"</p>

<p>He was choking with angry sobs, and he walked
about the apartment in a very excited frame of mind.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, something must be done!
Come, for my part, I don't know what to do! Suppose
we tried to rescue him, eh? While they are
bringing him to the Luxembourg, we could throw
ourselves on the escort in the passage! A dozen
resolute men&mdash;that sometimes is enough to accomplish
it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>There was so much fire in his eyes that Frederick
was a little startled by his look. He recalled to mind
S&eacute;n&eacute;cal's sufferings and his austere life. Without feeling
the same enthusiasm about him as Dussardier, he
experienced nevertheless that admiration which is inspired
by every man who sacrifices himself for an
idea. He said to himself that, if he had helped this
man, he would not be in his present position; and
the two friends anxiously sought to devise some contrivance
whereby they could set him free.</p>

<p>It was impossible for them to get access to him.</p>

<p>Frederick examined the newspapers to try to find
out what had become of him, and for three weeks
he was a constant visitor at the reading-rooms.</p>

<p>One day several numbers of the <i>Flambard</i> fell into
his hands. The leading article was invariably devoted
to cutting up some distinguished man. After
that came some society gossip and some scandals.
Then there were some chaffing observations about
the Od&eacute;on Carpentras, pisciculture, and prisoners under
sentence of death, when there happened to be
any. The disappearance of a packet-boat furnished
materials for a whole year's jokes. In the third column
a picture-canvasser, under the form of anecdotes
or advice, gave some tailors' announcements, together
with accounts of evening parties, advertisements as to
auctions, and analysis of artistic productions, writing
in the same strain about a volume of verse and a pair
of boots. The only serious portion of it was the criticism
of the small theatres, in which fierce attacks were
made on two or three managers; and the interests of
art were invoked on the subjects of the decorations of
the Rope-dancers' Gymnasium and of the actress who
played the part of the heroine at the D&eacute;lassements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick was passing over all these items when
his eyes alighted on an article entitled "A Lass between
three Lads." It was the story of his duel
related in a lively Gallic style. He had no difficulty
in recognising himself, for he was indicated by this
little joke, which frequently recurred: "A young man
from the College of Sens who has no sense." He
was even represented as a poor devil from the provinces,
an obscure booby trying to rub against persons of
high rank. As for the Vicomte, he was made to play
a fascinating part, first by having forced his way into
the supper-room, then by having carried off the lady,
and, finally, by having behaved all through like a perfect
gentleman.</p>

<p>Frederick's courage was not denied exactly, but it
was pointed out that an intermediary&mdash;the <i>protector</i>
himself&mdash;had come on the scene just in the nick of
time. The entire article concluded with this phrase,
pregnant perhaps with sinister meaning:</p>

<p>"What is the cause of their affection? A problem!
and, as Bazile says, who the deuce is it that is deceived
here?"</p>

<p>This was, beyond all doubt, Hussonnet's revenge
against Frederick for having refused him five thousand
francs.</p>

<p>What was he to do? If he demanded an explanation
from him, the Bohemian would protest that he
was innocent, and nothing would be gained by doing
this. The best course was to swallow the affront in
silence. Nobody, after all, read the <i>Flambard</i>.</p>

<p>As he left the reading-room, he saw some people
standing in front of a picture-dealer's shop. They
were staring at the portrait of a woman, with this
fine traced underneath in black letters: "Mademoiselle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Rosanette Bron, belonging to M. Frederick Moreau
of Nogent."</p>

<p>It was indeed she&mdash;or, at least, like her&mdash;her full
face displayed, her bosom uncovered, with her hair
hanging loose, and with a purse of red velvet in her
hands, while behind her a peacock leaned his beak
over her shoulder, covering the wall with his immense
plumage in the shape of a fan.</p>

<p>Pellerin had got up this exhibition in order to
compel Frederick to pay, persuaded that he was a
celebrity, and that all Paris, roused to take his part,
would be interested in this wretched piece of work.</p>

<p>Was this a conspiracy? Had the painter and the
journalist prepared their attack on him at the same
time?</p>

<p>His duel had not put a stop to anything. He had
become an object of ridicule, and everyone had been
laughing at him.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards, at the end of June, the
Northern shares having had a rise of fifteen francs, as
he had bought two thousand of them within the past
month, he found that he had made thirty thousand
francs by them. This caress of fortune gave him renewed
self-confidence. He said to himself that he
wanted nobody's help, and that all his embarrassments
were the result of his timidity and indecision.
He ought to have begun his intrigue with the Mar&eacute;chale
with brutal directness and refused Hussonnet
the very first day. He should not have compromised
himself with Pellerin. And, in order to show that he
was not a bit embarrassed, he presented himself at
one of Madame Dambreuse's ordinary evening parties.</p>

<p>In the middle of the anteroom, Martinon, who had
arrived at the same time as he had, turned round:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"What! so you are visiting here?" with a look
of surprise, and as if displeased at seeing him.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>And, while asking himself what could be the cause
of such a display of hostility on Martinon's part, Frederick
made his way into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>The light was dim, in spite of the lamps placed
in the corners, for the three windows, which were
wide open, made three large squares of black shadow
stand parallel with each other. Under the pictures,
flower-stands occupied, at a man's height, the spaces
on the walls, and a silver teapot with a samovar cast
their reflections in a mirror on the background. There
arose a murmur of hushed voices. Pumps could be
heard creaking on the carpet. He could distinguish a
number of black coats, then a round table lighted
up by a large shaded lamp, seven or eight ladies in
summer toilets, and at some little distance Madame
Dambreuse in a rocking armchair. Her dress of lilac
taffeta had slashed sleeves, from which fell muslin
puffs, the charming tint of the material harmonising
with the shade of her hair; and she sat slightly thrown
back with the tip of her foot on a cushion, with the
repose of an exquisitely delicate work of art, a flower
of high culture.</p>

<p>M. Dambreuse and an old gentleman with a white
head were walking from one end of the drawing-room
to the other. Some of the guests chatted here
and there, sitting on the edges of little sofas, while
the others, standing up, formed a circle in the centre
of the apartment.</p>

<p>They were talking about votes, amendments,
counter-amendments, M. Grandin's speech, and M.
Benoist's reply. The third party had decidedly gone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
too far. The Left Centre ought to have had a better
recollection of its origin. Serious attacks had been
made on the ministry. It must be reassuring, however,
to see that it had no successor. In short, the
situation was completely analogous to that of 1834.</p>

<p>As these things bored Frederick, he drew near the
ladies. Martinon was beside them, standing up, with
his hat under his arm, showing himself in three-quarter
profile, and looking so neat that he resembled a
piece of S&egrave;vres porcelain. He took up a copy of the
<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> which was lying on the
table between an <i>Imitation</i> and an <i>Almanach de
Gotha</i>, and spoke of a distinguished poet in a contemptuous
tone, said he was going to the "conferences
of Saint-Francis," complained of his larynx,
swallowed from time to time a pellet of gummatum,
and in the meantime kept talking about music, and
played the part of the elegant trifler. Mademoiselle
C&eacute;cile, M. Dambreuse's niece, who happened to be
embroidering a pair of ruffles, gazed at him with her
pale blue eyes; and Miss John, the governess, who
had a flat nose, laid aside her tapestry on his account.
Both of them appeared to be exclaiming internally:</p>

<p>"How handsome he is!"</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse turned round towards him.</p>

<p>"Please give me my fan which is on that pier-table
over there. You are taking the wrong one! 'tis
the other!"</p>

<p>She arose, and when he came across to her, they
met in the middle of the drawing-room face to
face. She addressed a few sharp words to him, no
doubt of a reproachful character, judging by the
haughty expression of her face. Martinon tried to
smile; then he went to join the circle in which grave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
men were holding discussions. Madame Dambreuse
resumed her seat, and, bending over the arm of her
chair, said to Frederick:</p>

<p>"I saw somebody the day before yesterday who
was speaking to me about you&mdash;Monsieur de Cisy.
You know him, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, slightly."</p>

<p>Suddenly Madame Dambreuse uttered an exclamation:</p>

<p>"Oh! Duchesse, what a pleasure to see you!"</p>

<p>And she advanced towards the door to meet a
little old lady in a Carmelite taffeta gown and a cap
of guipure with long borders. The daughter of a
companion in exile of the Comte d'Artois, and
the widow of a marshal of the Empire; who had
been created a peer of France in 1830, she adhered
to the court of a former generation as well as to the
new court, and possessed sufficient influence to procure
many things. Those who stood talking stepped
aside, and then resumed their conversation.</p>

<p>It had now turned on pauperism, of which, according
to these gentlemen, all the descriptions that
had been given were grossly exaggerated.</p>

<p>"However," urged Martinon, "let us confess that
there is such a thing as want! But the remedy depends
neither on science nor on power. It is purely
an individual question. When the lower classes are
willing to get rid of their vices, they will free themselves
from their necessities. Let the people be more
moral, and they will be less poor!"</p>

<p>According to M. Dambreuse, no good could be attained
without a superabundance of capital. Therefore,
the only practicable method was to intrust, "as
the Saint-Simonians, however, proposed (good heavens!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
there was some merit in their views&mdash;let us be just
to everybody)&mdash;to intrust, I say, the cause of progress
to those who can increase the public wealth." Imperceptibly
they began to touch on great industrial
undertakings&mdash;the railways, the coal-mines. And M.
Dambreuse, addressing Frederick, said to him in a low
whisper:</p>

<p>"You have not called about that business of ours?"</p>

<p>Frederick pleaded illness; but, feeling that this excuse
was too absurd:</p>

<p>"Besides, I need my ready money."</p>

<p>"Is it to buy a carriage?" asked Madame Dambreuse,
who was brushing past him with a cup of tea
in her hand, and for a minute she watched his face
with her head bent slightly over her shoulder.</p>

<p>She believed that he was Rosanette's lover&mdash;the
allusion was obvious. It seemed even to Frederick
that all the ladies were staring at him from a distance
and whispering to one another.</p>

<p>In order to get a better idea as to what they were
thinking about, he once more approached them. On
the opposite side of the table, Martinon, seated near
Mademoiselle C&eacute;cile, was turning over the leaves of
an album. It contained lithographs representing Spanish
costumes. He read the descriptive titles aloud:
"A Lady of Seville," "A Valencia Gardener," "An
Andalusian Picador"; and once, when he had reached
the bottom of the page, he continued all in one
breath:</p>

<p>"Jacques Arnoux, publisher. One of your friends,
eh?"</p>

<p>"That is true," said Frederick, hurt by the tone he
had assumed.</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse again interposed:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"In fact, you came here one morning&mdash;about a
house, I believe&mdash;a house belonging to his wife."
(This meant: "She is your mistress.")</p>

<p>He reddened up to his ears; and M. Dambreuse,
who joined them at the same moment, made this additional
remark:</p>

<p>"You appear even to be deeply interested in them."</p>

<p>These last words had the effect of putting Frederick
out of countenance. His confusion, which, he
could not help feeling, was evident to them, was on
the point of confirming their suspicions, when M.
Dambreuse drew close to him, and, in a tone of great
seriousness, said:</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't do business together?"</p>

<p>He protested by repeated shakes of the head, without
realising the exact meaning of the capitalist, who
wished to give him advice.</p>

<p>He felt a desire to leave. The fear of appearing
faint-hearted restrained him. A servant carried away
the teacups. Madame Dambreuse was talking to a
diplomatist in a blue coat. Two young girls, drawing
their foreheads close together, showed each
other their jewellery. The others, seated in a semicircle
on armchairs, kept gently moving their white
faces crowned with black or fair hair. Nobody, in
fact, minded them. Frederick turned on his heels;
and, by a succession of long zigzags, he had almost
reached the door, when, passing close to a bracket,
he remarked, on the top of it, between a china vase
and the wainscoting, a journal folded up in two. He
drew it out a little, and read these words&mdash;<i>The Flambard</i>.</p>

<p>Who had brought it there? Cisy. Manifestly no
one else. What did it matter, however? They would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
believe&mdash;already, perhaps, everyone believed&mdash;in the
article. What was the cause of this rancour? He
wrapped himself up in ironical silence. He felt like
one lost in a desert. But suddenly he heard Martinon's
voice:</p>

<p>"Talking of Arnoux, I saw in the newspapers,
amongst the names of those accused of preparing incendiary
bombs, that of one of his <i>employ&eacute;s</i>, S&eacute;n&eacute;cal.
Is that our S&eacute;n&eacute;cal?"</p>

<p>"The very same!"</p>

<p>Martinon repeated several times in a very loud
tone:</p>

<p>"What? our S&eacute;n&eacute;cal! our S&eacute;n&eacute;cal!"</p>

<p>Then questions were asked him about the conspiracy.
It was assumed that his connection with the
prosecutor's office ought to furnish him with some information
on the subject.</p>

<p>He declared that he had none. However, he knew
very little about this individual, having seen him only
two or three times. He positively regarded him as a
very ill-conditioned fellow. Frederick exclaimed indignantly:</p>

<p>"Not at all! he is a very honest fellow."</p>

<p>"All the same, Monsieur," said a landowner, "no
conspirator can be an honest man."</p>

<p>Most of the men assembled there had served at
least four governments; and they would have sold
France or the human race in order to preserve their
own incomes, to save themselves from any discomfort
or embarrassment, or even through sheer baseness,
through worship of force. They all maintained
that political crimes were inexcusable. It would be
more desirable to pardon those which were provoked
by want. And they did not fail to put forward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
eternal illustration of the father of a family stealing
the eternal loaf of bread from the eternal baker.</p>

<p>A gentleman occupying an administrative office
even went so far as to exclaim:</p>

<p>"For my part, Monsieur, if I were told that my
brother were a conspirator I would denounce him!"</p>

<p>Frederick invoked the right of resistance, and recalling
to mind some phrases that Deslauriers had
used in their conversations, he referred to Delosmes,
Blackstone, the English Bill of Rights, and Article 2
of the Constitution of '91. It was even by virtue of
this law that the fall of Napol&eacute;on had been proclaimed.
It had been recognised in 1830, and inscribed
at the head of the Charter. Besides, when
the sovereign fails to fulfil the contract, justice requires
that he should be overthrown.</p>

<p>"Why, this is abominable!" exclaimed a prefect's
wife.</p>

<p>All the rest remained silent, filled with vague
terror, as if they had heard the noise of bullets. Madame
Dambreuse rocked herself in her chair, and
smiled as she listened to him.</p>

<p>A manufacturer, who had formerly been a member
of the Carbonari, tried to show that the Orl&eacute;ans
family possessed good qualities. No doubt there were
some abuses.</p>

<p>"Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"But we should not talk about them, my dear
Monsieur! If you knew how all these clamourings of
the Opposition injure business!"</p>

<p>"What do I care about business?" said Frederick.</p>

<p>He was exasperated by the rottenness of these old
men; and, carried away by the recklessness which
sometimes takes possession of even the most timid,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
he attacked the financiers, the deputies, the government,
the king, took up the defence of the Arabs,
and gave vent to a great deal of abusive language.
A few of those around him encouraged him in a
spirit of irony:</p>

<p>"Go on, pray! continue!" whilst others muttered:
"The deuce! what enthusiasm!" At last he thought
the right thing to do was to retire; and, as he was
going away, M. Dambreuse said to him, alluding to
the post of secretary:</p>

<p>"No definite arrangement has been yet arrived at;
but make haste!"</p>

<p>And Madame Dambreuse:</p>

<p>"You'll call again soon, will you not?"</p>

<p>Frederick considered their parting salutation a last
mockery. He had resolved never to come back to this
house, or to visit any of these people again. He imagined
that he had offended them, not realising what
vast funds of indifference society possesses. These
women especially excited his indignation. Not a single
one of them had backed him up even with a look
of sympathy. He felt angry with them for not having
been moved by his words. As for Madame Dambreuse,
he found in her something at the same time languid
and cold, which prevented him from defining her
character by a formula. Had she a lover? and, if so,
who was her lover? Was it the diplomatist or some
other? Perhaps it was Martinon? Impossible! Nevertheless,
he experienced a sort of jealousy against Martinon,
and an unaccountable ill-will against her.</p>

<p>Dussardier, having called this evening as usual,
was awaiting him. Frederick's heart was swelling
with bitterness; he unburdened it, and his grievances,
though vague and hard to understand, saddened the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
honest shop-assistant. He even complained of his
isolation. Dussardier, after a little hesitation, suggested
that they ought to call on Deslauriers.</p>

<p>Frederick, at the mention of the advocate's name,
was seized with a longing to see him once more.
He was now living in the midst of profound intellectual
solitude, and found Dussardier's company quite
insufficient. In reply to the latter's question, Frederick
told him to arrange matters any way he liked.</p>

<p>Deslauriers had likewise, since their quarrel, felt
a void in his life. He yielded without much reluctance
to the cordial advances which were made to
him. The pair embraced each other, then began
chatting about matters of no consequence.</p>

<p>Frederick's heart was touched by Deslauriers' display
of reserve, and in order to make him a sort of reparation,
he told the other next day how he had lost the
fifteen thousand francs without mentioning that these
fifteen thousand francs had been originally intended
for him. The advocate, nevertheless, had a shrewd
suspicion of the truth; and this misadventure, which
justified, in his own mind, his prejudices against Arnoux,
entirely disarmed his rancour; and he did not
again refer to the promise made by his friend on a
former occasion.</p>

<p>Frederick, misled by his silence, thought he had
forgotten all about it. A few days afterwards, he
asked Deslauriers whether there was any way in
which he could get back his money.</p>

<p>They might raise the point that the prior mortgage
was fraudulent, and might take proceedings
against the wife personally.</p>

<p>"No! no! not against her!" exclaimed Frederick,
and, yielding to the ex-law-clerk's questions, he con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>fessed
the truth. Deslauriers was convinced that
Frederick had not told him the entire truth, no doubt
through a feeling of delicacy. He was hurt by this
want of confidence.</p>

<p>They were, however, on the same intimate terms
as before, and they even found so much pleasure in
each other's society that Dussardier's presence was
an obstacle to their free intercourse. Under the pretence
that they had appointments, they managed
gradually to get rid of him.</p>

<p>There are some men whose only mission amongst
their fellow-men is to serve as go-betweens; people
use them in the same way as if they were bridges,
by stepping over them and going on further.</p>

<p>Frederick concealed nothing from his old friend.
He told him about the coal-mine speculation and M.
Dambreuse's proposal. The advocate grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>"That's queer! For such a post a man with a
good knowledge of law would be required!"</p>

<p>"But you could assist me," returned Frederick.</p>

<p>"Yes!&mdash;hold on! faith, yes! certainly."</p>

<p>During the same week Frederick showed Dussardier
a letter from his mother.</p>

<p>Madame Moreau accused herself of having misjudged
M. Roque, who had given a satisfactory explanation
of his conduct. Then she spoke of his
means, and of the possibility, later, of a marriage
with Louise.</p>

<p>"That would not be a bad match," said Deslauriers.</p>

<p>Frederick said it was entirely out of the question.
Besides, P&egrave;re Roque was an old trickster. That in
no way affected the matter, in the advocate's opinion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of July, an unaccountable diminution in
value made the Northern shares fall. Frederick had
not sold his. He lost sixty thousand francs in one
day. His income was considerably reduced. He
would have to curtail his expenditure, or take up
some calling, or make a brilliant catch in the matrimonial
market.</p>

<p>Then Deslauriers spoke to him about Mademoiselle
Roque. There was nothing to prevent him from going
to get some idea of things by seeing for himself.
Frederick was rather tired of city life. Provincial existence
and the maternal roof would be a sort of
recreation for him.</p>

<p>The aspect of the streets of Nogent, as he passed
through them in the moonlight, brought back old
memories to his mind; and he experienced a kind of
pang, like persons who have just returned home after
a long period of travel.</p>

<p>At his mother's house, all the country visitors had
assembled as in former days&mdash;MM. Gamblin, Heudras,
and Chambrion, the Lebrun family, "those young
ladies, the Augers," and, in addition, P&egrave;re Roque, and,
sitting opposite to Madame Moreau at a card-table,
Mademoiselle Louise. She was now a woman. She
sprang to her feet with a cry of delight. They were
all in a flutter of excitement. She remained standing
motionless, and the paleness of her face was intensified
by the light issuing from four silver candlesticks.</p>

<p>When she resumed play, her hand was trembling.
This emotion was exceedingly flattering to Frederick,
whose pride had been sorely wounded of late. He
said to himself: "You, at any rate, will love me!"
and, as if he were thus taking his revenge for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
humiliations he had endured in the capital, he began
to affect the Parisian lion, retailed all the theatrical
gossip, told anecdotes as to the doings of society,
which he had borrowed from the columns of the
cheap newspapers, and, in short, dazzled his fellow-townspeople.</p>

<p>Next morning, Madame Moreau expatiated on
Louise's fine qualities; then she enumerated the woods
and farms of which she would be the owner. P&egrave;re
Roque's wealth was considerable.</p>

<p>He had acquired it while making investments for
M. Dambreuse; for he had lent money to persons who
were able to give good security in the shape of
mortgages, whereby he was enabled to demand additional
sums or commissions. The capital, owing to
his energetic vigilance, was in no danger of being
lost. Besides, P&egrave;re Roque never had any hesitation
in making a seizure. Then he bought up the mortgaged
property at a low price, and M. Dambreuse,
having got back his money, found his affairs in very
good order.</p>

<p>But this manipulation of business matters in a way
which was not strictly legal compromised him with
his agent. He could refuse P&egrave;re Roque nothing, and
it was owing to the latter's solicitations that M. Dambreuse
had received Frederick so cordially.</p>

<p>The truth was that in the depths of his soul P&egrave;re
Roque cherished a deep-rooted ambition. He wished
his daughter to be a countess; and for the purpose of
gaining this object, without imperilling the happiness
of his child, he knew no other young man so well
adapted as Frederick.</p>

<p>Through the influence of M. Dambreuse, he could
obtain the title of his maternal grandfather, Madame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Moreau being the daughter of a Comte de Fouvens,
and besides being connected with the oldest families
in Champagne, the Lavernades and the D'Etrignys.
As for the Moreaus, a Gothic inscription near the
mills of Villeneuve-l'Archev&egrave;que referred to one Jacob
Moreau, who had rebuilt them in 1596; and the tomb
of his own son, Pierre Moreau, first esquire of the
king under Louis XIV., was to be seen in the chapel
of Saint-Nicholas.</p>

<p>So much family distinction fascinated M. Roque,
the son of an old servant. If the coronet of a count
did not come, he would console himself with something
else; for Frederick might get a deputyship when
M. Dambreuse had been raised to the peerage, and
might then be able to assist him in his commercial
pursuits, and to obtain for him supplies and grants.
He liked the young man personally. In short, he desired
to have Frederick for a son-in-law, because for
a long time past he had been smitten with this notion,
which only grew all the stronger day by day.
Now he went to religious services, and he had won
Madame Moreau over to his views, especially by
holding before her the prospect of a title.</p>

<p>So it was that, eight days later, without any
formal engagement, Frederick was regarded as Mademoiselle
Roque's "intended," and P&egrave;re Roque, who
was not troubled with many scruples, often left them
together.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="chapter_xii" id="chapter_xii"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">Little Louise Grows Up.</h3>



<p><img src="images/i_chxii.png" width="123" height="123" alt="D" title="" class="illodrop" style="margin-top: -3.5em;" />eslauriers had carried away from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Frederick's house the copy of the
deed of subrogation, with a power
of attorney in proper form, giving
him full authority to act; but,
when he had reascended his own
five flights of stairs and found himself alone in
the midst of his dismal room, in his armchair upholstered
in sheep-leather, the sight of the stamped
paper disgusted him.</p>

<p>He was tired of these things, and of restaurants
at thirty-two sous, of travelling in omnibuses, of enduring
want and making futile efforts. He took up
the papers again; there were others near them. They
were prospectuses of the coal-mining company, with
a list of the mines and the particulars as to their contents,
Frederick having left all these matters in his
hands in order to have his opinion about them.</p>

<p>An idea occurred to him&mdash;that of presenting himself
at M. Dambreuse's house and applying for the
post of secretary. This post, it was perfectly certain,
could not be obtained without purchasing a certain
number of shares. He recognised the folly of his
project, and said to himself:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! no, that would be a wrong step."</p>

<p>Then he ransacked his brains to think of the best
way in which he could set about recovering the fifteen
thousand francs. Such a sum was a mere trifle
to Frederick. But, if he had it, what a lever it
would be in his hands! And the ex-law-clerk was
indignant at the other being so well off.</p>

<p>"He makes a pitiful use of it. He is a selfish
fellow. Ah! what do I care for his fifteen thousand
francs!"</p>

<p>Why had he lent the money? For the sake of
Madame Arnoux's bright eyes. She was his mistress!
Deslauriers had no doubt about it. "There was
another way in which money was useful!"</p>

<p>And he was assailed by malignant thoughts.</p>

<p>Then he allowed his thoughts to dwell even on
Frederick's personal appearance. It had always exercised
over him an almost feminine charm; and he
soon came to admire it for a success which he realised
that he was himself incapable of achieving.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, was not the will the main element
in every enterprise? and, since by its means we may
triumph over everything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! that would be funny!"</p>

<p>But he felt ashamed of such treachery, and the
next moment:</p>

<p>"Pooh! I am afraid?"</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux&mdash;from having heard her spoken
about so often&mdash;had come to be depicted in his
imagination as something extraordinary. The persistency
of this passion had irritated him like a problem.
Her austerity, which seemed a little theatrical, now
annoyed him. Besides, the woman of the world&mdash;or,
rather, his own conception of her&mdash;dazzled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
advocate as a symbol and the epitome of a thousand
pleasures. Poor though he was, he hankered after
luxury in its more glittering form.</p>

<p>"After all, even though he should get angry, so
much the worse! He has behaved too badly to me
to call for any anxiety about him on my part! I
have no assurance that she is his mistress! He has
denied it. So then I am free to act as I please!"</p>

<p>He could no longer abandon the desire of taking this
step. He wished to make a trial of his own strength,
so that one day, all of a sudden, he polished his boots
himself, bought white gloves, and set forth on his
way, substituting himself for Frederick, and almost
imagining that he was the other by a singular intellectual
evolution, in which there was, at the same time,
vengeance and sympathy, imitation and audacity.</p>

<p>He announced himself as "Doctor Deslauriers."</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux was surprised, as she had not
sent for any physician.</p>

<p>"Ha! a thousand apologies!&mdash;'tis a doctor of law!
I have come in Monsieur Moreau's interest."</p>

<p>This name appeared to produce a disquieting effect
on her mind.</p>

<p>"So much the better!" thought the ex-law-clerk.</p>

<p>"Since she has a liking for him, she will like me,
too!" buoying up his courage with the accepted idea
that it is easier to supplant a lover than a husband.</p>

<p>He referred to the fact that he had the pleasure of
meeting her on one occasion at the law-courts; he
even mentioned the date. This remarkable power of
memory astonished Madame Arnoux. He went on in
a tone of mild affectation:</p>

<p>"You have already found your affairs a little embarrassing?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>"Then it must be true."</p>

<p>He began to chat about one thing or another,
about her house, about the works; then, noticing
some medallions at the sides of the mirror:</p>

<p>"Ha! family portraits, no doubt?"</p>

<p>He remarked that of an old lady, Madame Arnoux's
mother.</p>

<p>"She has the appearance of an excellent woman,
a southern type."</p>

<p>And, on being met with the objection that she
was from Chartres:</p>

<p>"Chartres! pretty town!"</p>

<p>He praised its cathedral and public buildings, and
coming back to the portrait, traced resemblances between
it and Madame Arnoux, and cast flatteries at
her indirectly. She did not appear to be offended at
this. He took confidence, and said that he had known
Arnoux a long time.</p>

<p>"He is a fine fellow, but one who compromises
himself. Take this mortgage, for example&mdash;one can't
imagine such a reckless act&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said she, shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>This involuntary evidence of contempt induced Deslauriers
to continue. "That kaolin business of his
was near turning out very badly, a thing you may
not be aware of, and even his reputation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A contraction of the brows made him pause.</p>

<p>Then, falling back on generalities, he expressed
his pity for the "poor women whose husbands frittered
away their means."</p>

<p>"But in this case, monsieur, the means belong to
him. As for me, I have nothing!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>No matter, one never knows. A woman of experience
might be useful. He made offers of devotion,
exalted his own merits; and he looked into her
face through his shining spectacles.</p>

<p>She was seized with a vague torpor; but suddenly
said:</p>

<p>"Let us look into the matter, I beg of you."</p>

<p>He exhibited the bundle of papers.</p>

<p>"This is Frederick's letter of attorney. With such
a document in the hands of a process-server, who
would make out an order, nothing could be easier;
in twenty-four hours&mdash;&mdash;" (She remained impassive;
he changed his man&oelig;uvre.)</p>

<p>"As for me, however, I don't understand what
impels him to demand this sum, for, in fact, he
doesn't want it."</p>

<p>"How is that? Monsieur Moreau has shown himself
so kind."</p>

<p>"Oh! granted!"</p>

<p>And Deslauriers began by eulogising him, then in
a mild fashion disparaged him, giving it out that he
was a forgetful individual, and over-fond of money.</p>

<p>"I thought he was your friend, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"That does not prevent me from seeing his defects.
Thus, he showed very little recognition of&mdash;how
shall I put it?&mdash;the sympathy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux was turning over the leaves of a
large manuscript book.</p>

<p>She interrupted him in order to get him to explain
a certain word.</p>

<p>He bent over her shoulder, and his face came so
close to hers that he grazed her cheek. She blushed.
This heightened colour inflamed Deslauriers, he hungrily
kissed her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you doing, Monsieur?" And, standing
up against the wall, she compelled him to remain
perfectly quiet under the glance of her large blue
eyes glowing with anger.</p>

<p>"Listen to me! I love you!"</p>

<p>She broke into a laugh, a shrill, discouraging
laugh. Deslauriers felt himself suffocating with anger.
He restrained his feelings, and, with the look of a
vanquished person imploring mercy:</p>

<p>"Ha! you are wrong! As for me, I would not
go like him."</p>

<p>"Of whom, pray, are you talking?"</p>

<p>"Of Frederick."</p>

<p>"Ah! Monsieur Moreau troubles me little. I told
you that!"</p>

<p>"Oh! forgive me! forgive me!" Then, drawling
his words, in a sarcastic tone:</p>

<p>"I even imagined that you were sufficiently interested
in him personally to learn with pleasure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She became quite pale. The ex-law-clerk added:</p>

<p>"He is going to be married."</p>

<p>"He!"</p>

<p>"In a month at latest, to Mademoiselle Roque, the
daughter of M. Dambreuse's agent. He has even
gone down to Nogent for no other purpose but that."</p>

<p>She placed her hand over her heart, as if at the
shock of a great blow; but immediately she rang the
bell. Deslauriers did not wait to be ordered to leave.
When she turned round he had disappeared.</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux was gasping a little with the
strain of her emotions. She drew near the window
to get a breath of air.</p>

<p>On the other side of the street, on the footpath,
a packer in his shirt-sleeves was nailing down a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
trunk. Hackney-coaches passed. She closed the
window-blinds and then came and sat down. As
the high houses in the vicinity intercepted the sun's
rays, the light of day stole coldly into the apartment.
Her children had gone out; there was not a stir
around her. It seemed as if she were utterly deserted.</p>

<p>"He is going to be married! Is it possible?"</p>

<p>And she was seized with a fit of nervous trembling.</p>

<p>"Why is this? Does it mean that I love him?"</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden:</p>

<p>"Why, yes; I love him&mdash;I love him!"</p>

<p>It seemed to her as if she were sinking into endless
depths. The clock struck three. She listened to
the vibrations of the sounds as they died away. And
she remained on the edge of the armchair, with her
eyeballs fixed and an unchanging smile on her face.</p>

<p>The same afternoon, at the same moment, Frederick
and Mademoiselle Louise were walking in the
garden belonging to M. Roque at the end of the
island.</p>

<p>Old Catherine was watching them, some distance
away. They were walking side by side and Frederick
said:</p>

<p>"You remember when I brought you into the
country?"</p>

<p>"How good you were to me!" she replied.
"You assisted me in making sand-pies, in filling my
watering-pot, and in rocking me in the swing!"</p>

<p>"All your dolls, who had the names of queens
and marchionesses&mdash;what has become of them?"</p>

<p>"Really, I don't know!"</p>

<p>"And your pug Moricaud?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's drowned, poor darling!"</p>

<p>"And the <i>Don Quixote</i> of which we coloured the
engravings together?"</p>

<p>"I have it still!"</p>

<p>He recalled to her mind the day of her first communion,
and how pretty she had been at vespers, with
her white veil and her large wax-taper, whilst the
girls were all taking their places in a row around the
choir, and the bell was tinkling.</p>

<p>These memories, no doubt, had little charm for
Mademoiselle Roque. She had not a word to say;
and, a minute later:</p>

<p>"Naughty fellow! never to have written a line to
me, even once!"</p>

<p>Frederick urged by way of excuse his numerous
occupations.</p>

<p>"What, then, are you doing?"</p>

<p>He was embarrassed by the question; then he
told her that he was studying politics.</p>

<p>"Ha!"</p>

<p>And without questioning him further:</p>

<p>"That gives you occupation; while as for me&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Then she spoke to him about the barrenness of
her existence, as there was nobody she could go to
see, and nothing to amuse her or distract her thoughts.
She wished to go on horseback.</p>

<p>"The vicar maintains that this is improper for a
young lady! How stupid these proprieties are! Long
ago they allowed me to do whatever I pleased; now,
they won't let me do anything!"</p>

<p>"Your father, however, is fond of you!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She heaved a sigh, which meant: "That is not
enough to make me happy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there was silence. They heard only the
noise made by their boots in the sand, together with
the murmur of falling water; for the Seine, above
Nogent, is cut into two arms. That which turns the
mills discharges in this place the superabundance of
its waves in order to unite further down with the
natural course of the stream; and a person coming
from the bridge could see at the right, on the other
bank of the river, a grassy slope on which a white
house looked down. At the left, in the meadow, a
row of poplar-trees extended, and the horizon in
front was bounded by a curve of the river. It was
flat, like a mirror. Large insects hovered over the
noiseless water. Tufts of reeds and rushes bordered
it unevenly; all kinds of plants which happened to
spring up there bloomed out in buttercups, caused
yellow clusters to hang down, raised trees in distaff-shape
with amaranth-blossoms, and made green rockets
spring up at random. In an inlet of the river white
water-lilies displayed themselves; and a row of ancient
willows, in which wolf-traps were hidden, formed,
on that side of the island, the sole protection of the
garden.</p>

<p>In the interior, on this side, four walls with a
slate coping enclosed the kitchen-garden, in which
the square patches, recently dug up, looked like
brown plates. The bell-glasses of the melons shone
in a row on the narrow hotbed. The artichokes, the
kidney-beans, the spinach, the carrots and the tomatoes
succeeded each other till one reached a background
where asparagus grew in such a fashion that
it resembled a little wood of feathers.</p>

<p>All this piece of land had been under the Directory
what is called "a folly." The trees had, since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
then, grown enormously. Clematis obstructed the
hornbeams, the walks were covered with moss,
brambles abounded on every side. Fragments of
statues let their plaster crumble in the grass. The
feet of anyone walking through the place got entangled
in iron-wire work. There now remained of the
pavilion only two apartments on the ground floor,
with some blue paper hanging in shreds. Before the
fa&ccedil;ade extended an arbour in the Italian style, in
which a vine-tree was supported on columns of brick
by a rail-work of sticks.</p>

<p>Soon they arrived at this spot; and, as the light
fell through the irregular gaps on the green herbage,
Frederick, turning his head on one side to speak to
Louise, noticed the shadow of the leaves on her face.</p>

<p>She had in her red hair, stuck in her chignon, a
needle, terminated by a glass bell in imitation of
emerald, and, in spite of her mourning, she wore (so
artless was her bad taste) straw slippers trimmed
with pink satin&mdash;a vulgar curiosity probably bought
at some fair.</p>

<p>He remarked this, and ironically congratulated her.</p>

<p>"Don't be laughing at me!" she replied.</p>

<p>Then surveying him altogether, from his grey felt
hat to his silk stockings:</p>

<p>"What an exquisite you are!"</p>

<p>After this, she asked him to mention some works
which she could read. He gave her the names of
several; and she said:</p>

<p>"Oh! how learned you are!"</p>

<p>While yet very small, she had been smitten with
one of those childish passions which have, at the
same time, the purity of a religion and the violence
of a natural instinct. He had been her comrade, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
brother, her master, had diverted her mind, made her
heart beat more quickly, and, without any desire for
such a result, had poured out into the very depths of
her being a latent and continuous intoxication. Then
he had parted with her at the moment of a tragic
crisis in her existence, when her mother had only just
died, and these two separations had been mingled together.
Absence had idealised him in her memory.
He had come back with a sort of halo round his head;
and she gave herself up ingenuously to the feelings
of bliss she experienced at seeing him once more.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life Frederick felt himself
beloved; and this new pleasure, which did not transcend
the ordinary run of agreeable sensations, made
his breast swell with so much emotion that he spread
out his two arms while he flung back his head.</p>

<p>A large cloud passed across the sky.</p>

<p>"It is going towards Paris," said Louise. "You'd
like to follow it&mdash;wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I! Why?"</p>

<p>"Who knows?"</p>

<p>And surveying him with a sharp look:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have there" (she searched her
mind for the appropriate phrase) "something to engage
your affections."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have nothing to engage my affections
there."</p>

<p>"Are you perfectly certain?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Mademoiselle, perfectly certain!"</p>

<p>In less than a year there had taken place in the
young girl an extraordinary transformation, which astonished
Frederick. After a minute's silence he added:</p>

<p>"We ought to 'thee' and 'thou' each other, as
we used to do long ago&mdash;shall we do so?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He persisted. She answered, with downcast face:</p>

<p>"I dare not!"</p>

<p>They had reached the end of the garden, which
was close to the shell-bank. Frederick, in a spirit of
boyish fun, began to send pebbles skimming over the
water. She bade him sit down. He obeyed; then,
looking at the waterfall:</p>

<p>"'Tis like Niagara!" He began talking about distant
countries and long voyages. The idea of making
some herself exercised a fascination over her mind.
She would not have been afraid either of tempests or
of lions.</p>

<p>Seated close beside each other, they collected in
front of them handfuls of sand, then, while they were
chatting, they let it slip through their fingers, and
the hot wind, which rose from the plains, carried
to them in puffs odours of lavender, together with
the smell of tar escaping from a boat behind the lock.
The sun's rays fell on the cascade. The greenish blocks
of stone in the little wall over which the water slipped
looked as if they were covered with a silver gauze
that was perpetually rolling itself out. A long strip
of foam gushed forth at the foot with a harmonious
murmur. Then it bubbled up, forming whirlpools
and a thousand opposing currents, which ended by
intermingling in a single limpid stream of water.</p>

<p>Louise said in a musing tone that she envied the
existence of fishes:</p>

<p>"It must be so delightful to tumble about down
there at your ease, and to feel yourself caressed on
every side."</p>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>


<div class="image"><a name="i058" id="i058"><img src="images/i058.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="" title="" /></a></div>
<div class="image"><img src="images/i058cap.jpg" width="531" height="656" alt="Can I live without you?" title="" /></div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>


<p>She shivered with sensuously enticing movements;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
but a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Your maid is calling you," said Frederick.</p>

<p>"All right! all right!" Louise did not disturb
herself.</p>

<p>"She will be angry," he suggested.</p>

<p>"It is all the same to me! and besides&mdash;&mdash;" Mademoiselle
Roque gave him to understand by a gesture
that the girl was entirely subject to her will.</p>

<p>She arose, however, and then complained of a
headache. And, as they were passing in front of a
large cart-shed containing some faggots:</p>

<p>"Suppose we sat down there, <i>under shelter</i>?"</p>

<p>He pretended not to understand this dialectic expression,
and even teased her about her accent.
Gradually the corners of her mouth were compressed,
she bit her lips; she stepped aside in order to sulk.</p>

<p>Frederick came over to her, swore he did not
mean to annoy her, and that he was very fond of her.</p>

<p>"Is that true?" she exclaimed, looking at him
with a smile which lighted up her entire face, smeared
over a little with patches of bran.</p>

<p>He could not resist the sentiment of gallantry
which was aroused in him by her fresh youthfulness,
and he replied:</p>

<p>"Why should I tell you a lie? Have you any
doubt about it, eh?" and, as he spoke, he passed his
left hand round her waist.</p>

<p>A cry, soft as the cooing of a dove, leaped up
from her throat. Her head fell back, she was going
to faint, when he held her up. And his virtuous
scruples were futile. At the sight of this maiden offering
herself to him he was seized with fear. He
assisted her to take a few steps slowly. He had
ceased to address her in soothing words, and no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
longer caring to talk of anything save the most trifling
subjects, he spoke to her about some of the principal
figures in the society of Nogent.</p>

<p>Suddenly she repelled him, and in a bitter tone:</p>

<p>"You would not have the courage to run away
with me!"</p>

<p>He remained motionless, with a look of utter
amazement in his face. She burst into sobs, and hiding
her face in his breast:</p>

<p>"Can I live without you?"</p>

<p>He tried to calm her emotion. She laid her two
hands on his shoulders in order to get a better view
of his face, and fixing her green eyes on his with
an almost fierce tearfulness:</p>

<p>"Will you be my husband?"</p>

<p>"But," Frederick began, casting about in his inner
consciousness for a reply. "Of course, I ask for
nothing better."</p>

<p>At that moment M. Roque's cap appeared behind
a lilac-tree.</p>

<p>He brought his young friend on a trip through
the district in order to show off his property; and
when Frederick returned, after two days' absence, he
found three letters awaiting him at his mother's house.</p>

<p>The first was a note from M. Dambreuse, containing
an invitation to dinner for the previous Tuesday.
What was the occasion of this politeness? So,
then, they had forgiven his prank.</p>

<p>The second was from Rosanette. She thanked
him for having risked his life on her behalf. Frederick
did not at first understand what she meant;
finally, after a considerable amount of circumlocution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
while appealing to his friendship, relying on his delicacy,
as she put it, and going on her knees to him
on account of the pressing necessity of the case, as
she wanted bread, she asked him for a loan of five
hundred francs. He at once made up his mind to
supply her with the amount.</p>

<p>The third letter, which was from Deslauriers,
spoke of the letter of attorney, and was long and
obscure. The advocate had not yet taken any definite
action. He urged his friend not to disturb himself:
"'Tis useless for you to come back!" even laying
singular stress on this point.</p>

<p>Frederick got lost in conjectures of every sort; and
he felt anxious to return to Paris. This assumption
of a right to control his conduct excited in him a
feeling of revolt.</p>

<p>Moreover, he began to experience that nostalgia
of the boulevard; and then, his mother was pressing
him so much, M. Roque kept revolving about him so
constantly, and Mademoiselle Louise was so much attached
to him, that it was no longer possible for
him to avoid speedily declaring his intentions.</p>

<p>He wanted to think, and he would be better able
to form a right estimate of things at a distance.</p>

<p>In order to assign a motive for his journey, Frederick
invented a story; and he left home, telling
everyone, and himself believing, that he would soon
return.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">Rosanette as a Lovely Turk.</h3>


<p><img src="images/i_chxiii.png" width="125" height="122" alt="H" title="" class="illodrop" style="margin-top: -3em" />is return to Paris gave him no pleasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
It was an evening at the close
of August. The boulevards seemed
empty. The passers-by succeeded
each other with scowling faces.
Here and there a boiler of asphalt
was smoking; several houses had their blinds entirely
drawn. He made his way to his own residence
in the city. He found the hangings covered
with dust; and, while dining all alone, Frederick was
seized with a strange feeling of forlornness; then his
thoughts reverted to Mademoiselle Roque. The idea
of being married no longer appeared to him preposterous.
They might travel; they might go to
Italy, to the East. And he saw her standing on a
hillock, or gazing at a landscape, or else leaning on
his arm in a Florentine gallery while she stood to look
at the pictures. What a pleasure it would be to him
merely to watch this good little creature expanding
under the splendours of Art and Nature! When she
had got free from the commonplace atmosphere in
which she had lived, she would, in a little while, become
a charming companion. M. Roque's wealth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
moreover, tempted him. And yet he shrank from
taking this step, regarding it as a weakness, a degradation.</p>

<p>But he was firmly resolved (whatever he might
do) on changing his mode of life&mdash;that is to say, to
lose his heart no more in fruitless passions; and he
even hesitated about executing the commission with
which he had been intrusted by Louise. This was to
buy for her at Jacques Arnoux's establishment two
large-sized statues of many colours representing
negroes, like those which were at the Prefecture at
Troyes. She knew the manufacturer's number, and
would not have any other. Frederick was afraid that,
if he went back to their house, he might once again
fall a victim to his old passion.</p>

<p>These reflections occupied his mind during the
entire evening; and he was just about to go to bed
when a woman presented herself.</p>

<p>"'Tis I," said Mademoiselle Vatnaz, with a laugh.
"I have come in behalf of Rosanette."</p>

<p>So, then, they were reconciled?</p>

<p>"Good heavens, yes! I am not ill-natured, as you
are well aware. And besides, the poor girl&mdash;it would
take too long to tell you all about it."</p>

<p>In short, the Mar&eacute;chale wanted to see him; she
was waiting for an answer, her letter having travelled
from Paris to Nogent. Mademoiselle Vatnaz did not
know what was in it.</p>

<p>Then Frederick asked her how the Mar&eacute;chale was
going on.</p>

<p>He was informed that she was now <i>with</i> a very
rich man, a Russian, Prince Tzernoukoff, who had
seen her at the races in the Champ de Mars last summer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has three carriages, a saddle-horse, livery
servants, a groom got up in the English fashion, a
country-house, a box at the Italian opera, and a heap
of other things. There you are, my dear friend!"</p>

<p>And the Vatnaz, as if she had profited by this
change of fortune, appeared gayer and happier. She
took off her gloves and examined the furniture and
the objects of virt&ugrave; in the room. She mentioned their
exact prices like a second-hand dealer. He ought to
have consulted her in order to get them cheaper.
Then she congratulated him on his good taste:</p>

<p>"Ha! this is pretty, exceedingly nice! There's nobody
like you for these ideas."</p>

<p>The next moment, as her eyes fell on a door close
to the pillar of the alcove:</p>

<p>"That's the way you let your friends out, eh?"</p>

<p>And, in a familiar fashion, she laid her finger on
his chin. He trembled at the contact of her long
hands, at the same time thin and soft. Round her
wrists she wore an edging of lace, and on the body
of her green dress lace embroidery, like a hussar.
Her bonnet of black tulle, with borders hanging down,
concealed her forehead a little. Her eyes shone underneath;
an odour of patchouli escaped from her head-bands.
The carcel-lamp placed on a round table,
shining down on her like the footlights of a theatre,
made her jaw protrude.</p>

<p>She said to him, in an unctuous tone, while
she drew forth from her purse three square slips of
paper:</p>

<p>"You will take these from me?"</p>

<p>They were three tickets for Delmar's benefit performance.</p>

<p>"What! for him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Vatnaz, without giving a further explanation,
added that she adored him more than ever.
If she were to be believed, the comedian was now
definitely classed amongst "the leading celebrities of
the age." And it was not such or such a personage
that he represented, but the very genius of France,
the People. He had "the humanitarian spirit; he
understood the priesthood of Art." Frederick, in order
to put an end to these eulogies, gave her the money
for the three seats.</p>

<p>"You need not say a word about this over the
way. How late it is, good heavens! I must leave
you. Ah! I was forgetting the address&mdash;'tis the Rue
Grange-Batelier, number 14."</p>

<p>And, at the door:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, beloved man!"</p>

<p>"Beloved by whom?" asked Frederick. "What a
strange woman!"</p>

<p>And he remembered that Dussardier had said to
him one day, when talking about her:</p>

<p>"Oh, she's not much!" as if alluding to stories of
a by no means edifying character.</p>

<p>Next morning he repaired to the Mar&eacute;chale's abode.
She lived in a new house, the spring-roller blinds of
which projected into the street. At the head of each
flight of stairs there was a mirror against the wall;
before each window there was a flower-stand, and all
over the steps extended a carpet of oil-cloth; and when
one got inside the door, the coolness of the staircase
was refreshing.</p>

<p>It was a man-servant who came to open the door,
a footman in a red waistcoat. On a bench in the
anteroom a woman and two men, tradespeople, no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
doubt, were waiting as if in a minister's vestibule.
At the left, the door of the dining-room, slightly ajar,
afforded a glimpse of empty bottles on the sideboards,
and napkins on the backs of chairs; and parallel with
it ran a corridor in which gold-coloured sticks supported
an espalier of roses. In the courtyard below,
two boys with bare arms were scrubbing a landau.
Their voices rose to Frederick's ears, mingled with
the intermittent sounds made by a currycomb knocking
against a stone.</p>

<p>The man-servant returned. "Madame will receive
Monsieur," and he led Frederick through a second
anteroom, and then into a large drawing-room hung
with yellow brocatel with twisted fringes at the corners
which were joined at the ceiling, and which
seemed to be continued by flowerings of lustre resembling
cables. No doubt there had been an entertainment
there the night before. Some cigar-ashes
had been allowed to remain on the pier-tables.</p>

<p>At last he found his way into a kind of boudoir
with stained-glass windows, through which the sun
shed a dim light. Trefoils of carved wood adorned
the upper portions of the doors. Behind a balustrade,
three purple mattresses formed a divan; and the stem
of a narghileh made of platinum lay on top of it.
Instead of a mirror, there was on the mantelpiece a
pyramid-shaped whatnot, displaying on its shelves an
entire collection of curiosities, old silver trumpets, Bohemian
horns, jewelled clasps, jade studs, enamels,
grotesque figures in china, and a little Byzantine virgin
with a vermilion ape; and all this was mingled
in a golden twilight with the bluish shade of the carpet,
the mother-of-pearl reflections of the foot-stools,
and the tawny hue of the walls covered with maroon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
leather. In the corners, on little pedestals, there were
bronze vases containing clusters of flowers, which
made the atmosphere heavy.</p>

<p>Rosanette presented herself, attired in a pink satin
vest with white cashmere trousers, a necklace of piasters,
and a red cap encircled with a branch of jasmine.</p>

<p>Frederick started back in surprise, then said he had
brought the thing she had been speaking about, and
he handed her the bank-note. She gazed at him in
astonishment; and, as he still kept the note in his
hand, without knowing where to put it:</p>

<p>"Pray take it!"</p>

<p>She seized it; then, as she flung it on the divan:</p>

<p>"You are very kind."</p>

<p>She wanted it to meet the rent of a piece of ground
at Bellevue, which she paid in this way every year.
Her unceremoniousness wounded Frederick's sensibility.
However, so much the better! this would
avenge him for the past.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said she. "There&mdash;closer." And
in a grave tone: "In the first place, I have to thank
you, my dear friend, for having risked your life."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's nothing!"</p>

<p>"What! Why, 'tis a very noble act!"&mdash;and the
Mar&eacute;chale exhibited an embarrassing sense of gratitude;
for it must have been impressed upon her mind that
the duel was entirely on account of Arnoux, as the
latter, who believed it himself, was not likely to have
resisted the temptation of telling her so.</p>

<p>"She is laughing at me, perhaps," thought Frederick.</p>

<p>He had nothing further to detain him, and, pleading
that he had an appointment, he rose.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, stay!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>He resumed his seat, and presently complimented
her on her costume.</p>

<p>She replied, with an air of dejection:</p>

<p>"'Tis the Prince who likes me to dress in this
fashion! And one must smoke such machines as that,
too!" Rosanette added, pointing towards the narghileh.
"Suppose we try the taste of it? Have you
any objection?"</p>

<p>She procured a light, and, finding it hard to set
fire to the tobacco, she began to stamp impatiently
with her foot. Then a feeling of languor took possession
of her; and she remained motionless on the
divan, with a cushion under her arm and her body
twisted a little on one side, one knee bent and the
other leg straight out.</p>

<p>The long serpent of red morocco, which formed
rings on the floor, rolled itself over her arm. She
rested the amber mouthpiece on her lips, and gazed
at Frederick while she blinked her eyes in the midst
of the cloud of smoke that enveloped her. A gurgling
sound came from her throat as she inhaled the fumes,
and from time to time she murmured:</p>

<p>"The poor darling! the poor pet!"</p>

<p>He tried to find something of an agreeable nature
to talk about. The thought of Vatnaz recurred to his
memory.</p>

<p>He remarked that she appeared to him very lady-like.</p>

<p>"Yes, upon my word," replied the Mar&eacute;chale.
"She is very lucky in having me, that same lady!"&mdash;without
adding another word, so much reserve was
there in their conversation.</p>

<p>Each of them felt a sense of constraint, something
that formed a barrier to confidential relations between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
them. In fact, Rosanette's vanity had been flattered
by the duel, of which she believed herself to be the
occasion. Then, she was very much astonished that
he did not hasten to take advantage of his achievement;
and, in order to compel him to return to her,
she had invented this story that she wanted five hundred
francs. How was it that Frederick did not ask
for a little love from her in return? This was a piece
of refinement that filled her with amazement, and, with
a gush of emotion, she said to him:</p>

<p>"Will you come with us to the sea-baths?"</p>

<p>"What does 'us' mean?"</p>

<p>"Myself and my bird. I'll make you pass for a
cousin of mine, as in the old comedies."</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, you will take lodgings near ours."</p>

<p>The idea of hiding himself from a rich man humiliated
him.</p>

<p>"No! that is impossible."</p>

<p>"Just as you please!"</p>

<p>Rosanette turned away with tears in her eyes.
Frederick noticed this, and in order to testify the
interest which he took in her, he said that he was
delighted to see her at last in a comfortable position.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. What, then, was
troubling her? Was it, perchance, that she was not
loved.</p>

<p>"Oh! as for me, I have always people to love
me!"</p>

<p>She added:</p>

<p>"It remains to be seen in what way."</p>

<p>Complaining that she was "suffocating with the
heat," the Mar&eacute;chale unfastened her vest; and, without
any other garment round her body, save her silk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
chemise, she leaned her head on his shoulder so as
to awaken his tenderness.</p>

<p>A man of less introspective egoism would not
have bestowed a thought at such a moment on the
possibility of the Vicomte, M. de Comaing, or anyone
else appearing on the scene. But Frederick had
been too many times the dupe of these very glances
to compromise himself by a fresh humiliation.</p>

<p>She wished to know all about his relationships
and his amusements. She even enquired about his
financial affairs, and offered to lend him money if he
wanted it. Frederick, unable to stand it any longer,
took up his hat.</p>

<p>"I'm off, my pet! I hope you'll enjoy yourself
thoroughly down there. <i>Au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes wide; then, in a dry tone:</p>

<p>"<i>Au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p>He made his way out through the yellow drawing-room,
and through the second anteroom. There was
on the table, between a vase full of visiting-cards and
an inkstand, a chased silver chest. It was Madame
Arnoux's. Then he experienced a feeling of tenderness,
and, at the same time, as it were, the scandal of
a profanation. He felt a longing to raise his hands
towards it, and to open it. He was afraid of being
seen, and went away.</p>

<p>Frederick was virtuous. He did not go back to
the Arnouxs' house. He sent his man-servant to buy
the two negroes, having given him all the necessary
directions; and the case containing them set forth the
same evening for Nogent. Next morning, as he was
repairing to Deslauriers' lodgings, at the turn where
the Rue Vivienne opened out on the boulevard, Madame
Arnoux presented herself before him face to face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The first movement of each of them was to draw
back; then the same smile came to the lips of both,
and they advanced to meet each other. For a minute,
neither of them uttered a single word.</p>

<p>The sunlight fell round her, and her oval face,
her long eyelashes, her black lace shawl, which
showed the outline of her shoulders, her gown of
shot silk, the bouquet of violets at the corner of her
bonnet; all seemed to him to possess extraordinary
magnificence. An infinite softness poured itself out of
her beautiful eyes; and in a faltering voice, uttering
at random the first words that came to his lips:</p>

<p>"How is Arnoux?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thank you!"</p>

<p>"And your children?"</p>

<p>"They are very well!"</p>

<p>"Ah! ah! What fine weather we are getting, are
we not?"</p>

<p>"Splendid, indeed!"</p>

<p>"You're going out shopping?"</p>

<p>And, with a slow inclination of the head:</p>

<p>"Good-bye!"</p>

<p>She put out her hand, without having spoken one
word of an affectionate description, and did not even
invite him to dinner at her house. No matter! He
would not have given this interview for the most
delightful of adventures; and he pondered over its
sweetness as he proceeded on his way.</p>

<p>Deslauriers, surprised at seeing him, dissembled
his spite; for he cherished still through obstinacy some
hope with regard to Madame Arnoux; and he had
written to Frederick to prolong his stay in the country
in order to be free in his man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p>He informed Frederick, however, that he had pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>sented
himself at her house in order to ascertain if
their contract stipulated for a community of property
between husband and wife: in that case, proceedings
might be taken against the wife; "and she put on a
queer face when I told her about your marriage."</p>

<p>"Now, then! What an invention!"</p>

<p>"It was necessary in order to show that you
wanted your own capital! A person who was indifferent
would not have been attacked with the species
of fainting fit that she had."</p>

<p>"Really?" exclaimed Frederick.</p>

<p>"Ha! my fine fellow, you are betraying yourself!
Come! be honest!"</p>

<p>A feeling of nervous weakness stole over Madame
Arnoux's lover.</p>

<p>"Why, no! I assure you! upon my word of honour!"</p>

<p>These feeble denials ended by convincing Deslauriers.
He congratulated his friend, and asked him
for some details. Frederick gave him none, and even
resisted a secret yearning to concoct a few. As for
the mortgage, he told the other to do nothing about
it, but to wait. Deslauriers thought he was wrong
on this point, and remonstrated with him in rather a
churlish fashion.</p>

<p>He was, besides, more gloomy, malignant, and
irascible than ever. In a year, if fortune did not
change, he would embark for America or blow out
his brains. Indeed, he appeared to be in such a rage
against everything, and so uncompromising in his
radicalism, that Frederick could not keep from saying
to him:</p>

<p>"Here you are going on in the same way as
S&eacute;n&eacute;cal!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Deslauriers, at this remark, informed him that that
individual to whom he alluded had been discharged
from Sainte-Pelagie, the magisterial investigation having
failed to supply sufficient evidence, no doubt, to
justify his being sent for trial.</p>

<p>Dussardier was so much overjoyed at the release
of S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, that he wanted to invite his friends to
come and take punch with him, and begged of
Frederick to be one of the party, giving the latter,
at the same time, to understand that he would be
found in the company of Hussonnet, who had proved
himself a very good friend to S&eacute;n&eacute;cal.</p>

<p>In fact, the <i>Flambard</i> had just become associated
with a business establishment whose prospectus contained
the following references: "Vineyard Agency.
Office of Publicity. Debt Recovery and Intelligence
Office, etc." But the Bohemian was afraid that his
connection with trade might be prejudicial to his
literary reputation, and he had accordingly taken
the mathematician to keep the accounts. Although
the situation was a poor one, S&eacute;n&eacute;cal would but for
it have died of starvation. Not wishing to mortify
the worthy shopman, Frederick accepted his invitation.</p>

<p>Dussardier, three days beforehand, had himself
waxed the red floor of his garret, beaten the armchair,
and knocked off the dust from the chimney-piece,
on which might be seen under a globe an
alabaster timepiece between a stalactite and a cocoanut.
As his two chandeliers and his chamber candlestick
were not sufficient, he had borrowed two more
candlesticks from the doorkeeper; and these five lights
shone on the top of the chest of drawers, which was
covered with three napkins in order that it might be
fit to have placed on it in such a way as to look at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>tractive
some macaroons, biscuits, a fancy cake, and
a dozen bottles of beer. At the opposite side, close
to the wall, which was hung with yellow paper,
there was a little mahogany bookcase containing the
<i>Fables of Lachambeaudie</i>, the <i>Mysteries of Paris</i>,
and Norvins' <i>Napol&eacute;on</i>&mdash;and, in the middle of the
alcove, the face of B&eacute;ranger was smiling in a rosewood
frame.</p>

<p>The guests (in addition to Deslauriers and S&eacute;n&eacute;cal)
were an apothecary who had just been admitted, but
who had not enough capital to start in business for
himself, a young man of his own house, a town-traveller
in wines, an architect, and a gentleman employed
in an insurance office. Regimbart had not
been able to come. Regret was expressed at his
absence.</p>

<p>They welcomed Frederick with a great display of
sympathy, as they all knew through Dussardier what
he had said at M. Dambreuse's house. S&eacute;n&eacute;cal contented
himself with putting out his hand in a dignified
manner.</p>

<p>He remained standing near the chimney-piece. The
others seated, with their pipes in their mouths, listened
to him, while he held forth on universal suffrage,
from which he predicted as a result the triumph
of Democracy and the practical application of the
principles of the Gospel. However, the hour was at
hand. The banquets of the party of reform were becoming
more numerous in the provinces. Piedmont,
Naples, Tuscany&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis true," said Deslauriers, interrupting him
abruptly. "This cannot last longer!"</p>

<p>And he began to draw a picture of the situation.
We had sacrificed Holland to obtain from England the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
recognition of Louis Philippe; and this precious English
alliance was lost, owing to the Spanish marriages.
In Switzerland, M. Guizot, in tow with the Austrian,
maintained the treaties of 1815. Prussia, with her
Zollverein, was preparing embarrassments for us. The
Eastern question was still pending.</p>

<p>"The fact that the Grand Duke Constantine sends
presents to M. d'Aumale is no reason for placing confidence
in Russia. As for home affairs, never have so
many blunders, such stupidity, been witnessed. The
Government no longer even keeps up its majority.
Everywhere, indeed, according to the well-known expression,
it is naught! naught! naught! And in the
teeth of such public scandals," continued the advocate,
with his arms akimbo, "they declare themselves satisfied!"</p>

<p>The allusion to a notorious vote called forth applause.
Dussardier uncorked a bottle of beer; the
froth splashed on the curtains. He did not mind it.
He filled the pipes, cut the cake, offered each of
them a slice of it, and several times went downstairs
to see whether the punch was coming up; and ere
long they lashed themselves up into a state of excitement,
as they all felt equally exasperated against
Power. Their rage was of a violent character for no
other reason save that they hated injustice, and they
mixed up with legitimate grievances the most idiotic
complaints.</p>

<p>The apothecary groaned over the pitiable condition
of our fleet. The insurance agent could not tolerate
Marshal Soult's two sentinels. Deslauriers denounced
the Jesuits, who had just installed themselves publicly
at Lille. S&eacute;n&eacute;cal execrated M. Cousin much more
for eclecticism, by teaching that certitude can be de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>duced
from reason, developed selfishness and destroyed
solidarity. The traveller in wines, knowing very
little about these matters, remarked in a very loud
tone that he had forgotten many infamies:</p>

<p>"The royal carriage on the Northern line must have
cost eighty thousand francs. Who'll pay the amount?"</p>

<p>"Aye, who'll pay the amount?" repeated the
clerk, as angrily as if this amount had been drawn
out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>Then followed recriminations against the lynxes of
the Bourse and the corruption of officials. According
to S&eacute;n&eacute;cal they ought to go higher up, and lay the
blame, first of all, on the princes who had revived the
morals of the Regency period.</p>

<p>"Have you not lately seen the Duc de Montpensier's
friends coming back from Vincennes, no doubt
in a state of intoxication, and disturbing with their
songs the workmen of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine?"</p>

<p>"There was even a cry of 'Down with the
thieves!'" said the apothecary. "I was there, and I
joined in the cry!"</p>

<p>"So much the better! The people are at last waking
up since the Teste-Cubi&egrave;res case."<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>"For my part, that case caused me some pain,"
said Dussardier, "because it imputed dishonour to an
old soldier!"</p>

<p>"Do you know," S&eacute;n&eacute;cal went on, "what
they have discovered at the Duchesse de Praslin's
house&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But here the door was sent flying open with a kick.
Hussonnet entered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hail, messeigneurs," said he, as he seated himself
on the bed.</p>

<p>No allusion was made to his article, which he was
sorry, however, for having written, as the Mar&eacute;chale
had sharply reprimanded him on account of it.</p>

<p>He had just seen at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de Dumas the
<i>Chevalier de Maison-Rouge</i>, and declared that it seemed
to him a stupid play.</p>

<p>Such a criticism surprised the democrats, as this
drama, by its tendency, or rather by its scenery, flattered
their passions. They protested. S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, in order
to bring this discussion to a close, asked whether the
play served the cause of Democracy.</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps; but it is written in a style&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then, 'tis a good play. What is style?
'Tis the idea!"</p>

<p>And, without allowing Frederick to say a word:</p>

<p>"Now, I was pointing out that in the Praslin
case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hussonnet interrupted him:</p>

<p>"Ha! here's another worn-out trick! I'm disgusted
at it!"</p>

<p>"And others as well as you," returned Deslauriers.</p>

<p>"It has only got five papers taken. Listen while
I read this paragraph."</p>

<p>And drawing his note-book out of his pocket, he
read:</p>

<p>"'We have, since the establishment of the best
of republics, been subjected to twelve hundred and
twenty-nine press prosecutions, from which the results
to the writers have been imprisonment extending
over a period of three thousand one hundred and
forty-one years, and the light sum of seven million<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
one hundred and ten thousand five hundred francs by
way of fine.' That's charming, eh?"</p>

<p>They all sneered bitterly.</p>

<p>Frederick, incensed against the others, broke in:</p>

<p>"<i>The Democratie Pacifique</i> has had proceedings
taken against it on account of its feuilleton, a novel
entitled <i>The Woman's Share</i>."</p>

<p>"Come! that's good," said Hussonnet. "Suppose
they prevented us from having our share of the
women!"</p>

<p>"But what is it that's not prohibited?" exclaimed
Deslauriers. "To smoke in the Luxembourg is prohibited;
to sing the Hymn to Pius IX. is prohibited!"</p>

<p>"And the typographers' banquet has been interdicted,"
a voice cried, with a thick articulation.</p>

<p>It was that of an architect, who had sat concealed
in the shade of the alcove, and who had remained
silent up to that moment. He added that, the week
before, a man named Rouget had been convicted of
offering insults to the king.</p>

<p>"That gurnet<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> is fried," said Hussonnet.</p>

<p>This joke appeared so improper to S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, that he
reproached Hussonnet for defending the Juggler of
the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, the friend of the traitor Dumouriez.</p>

<p>"I? quite the contrary!"</p>

<p>He considered Louis Philippe commonplace, one of
the National Guard types of men, all that savoured most
of the provision-shop and the cotton night-cap! And
laying his hand on his heart, the Bohemian gave utterance
to the rhetorical phrases:</p>

<p>"It is always with a new pleasure.... Polish
nationality will not perish.... Our great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
works will be pursued.... Give me some money
for my little family...."</p>

<p>They all laughed hugely, declaring that he was a
delightful fellow, full of wit. Their delight was redoubled
at the sight of the bowl of punch which was
brought in by the keeper of a caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>The flames of the alcohol and those of the wax-candles
soon heated the apartment, and the light from
the garret, passing across the courtyard, illuminated
the side of an opposite roof with the flue of a chimney,
whose black outlines could be traced through
the darkness of night. They talked in very loud
tones all at the same time. They had taken off
their coats; they gave blows to the furniture; they
touched glasses.</p>

<p>Hussonnet exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Send up some great ladies, in order that this
may be more Tour de Nesles, have more local colouring,
and be more Rembrandtesque, gadzooks!"</p>

<p>And the apothecary, who kept stirring about the
punch indefinitely, began to sing with expanded chest:</p>

<p>
"I've two big oxen in my stable,<br />
Two big white oxen&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p>S&eacute;n&eacute;cal laid his hand on the apothecary's mouth;
he did not like disorderly conduct; and the lodgers
pressed their faces against the window-panes, surprised
at the unwonted uproar that was taking place in
Dussardier's room.</p>

<p>The honest fellow was happy, and said that this
recalled to his mind their little parties on the Quai
Napol&eacute;on in days gone by; however, they missed
many who used to be present at these reunions,
"Pellerin, for instance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can do without him," observed Frederick.</p>

<p>And Deslauriers enquired about Martinon.</p>

<p>"What has become of that interesting gentleman?"</p>

<p>Frederick, immediately giving vent to the ill-will
which he bore to Martinon, attacked his mental capacity,
his character, his false elegance, his entire
personality. He was a perfect specimen of an upstart
peasant! The new aristocracy, the mercantile class,
was not as good as the old&mdash;the nobility. He maintained
this, and the democrats expressed their approval,
as if he were a member of the one class, and
they were in the habit of visiting the other. They
were charmed with him. The apothecary compared
him to M. d'Alton Sh&eacute;e, who, though a peer of
France, defended the cause of the people.</p>

<p>The time had come for taking their departure.
They all separated with great handshakings. Dussardier,
in a spirit of affectionate solicitude, saw Frederick
and Deslauriers home. As soon as they were
in the street, the advocate assumed a thoughtful air,
and, after a moment's silence:</p>

<p>"You have a great grudge, then, against Pellerin?"</p>

<p>Frederick did not hide his rancour.</p>

<p>The painter, in the meantime, had withdrawn the
notorious picture from the show-window. A person
should not let himself be put out by trifles. What
was the good of making an enemy for himself?</p>

<p>"He has given way to a burst of ill-temper,
excusable in a man who hasn't a sou. You, of
course, can't understand that!"</p>

<p>And, when Deslauriers had gone up to his own
apartments, the shopman did not part with Frederick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
He even urged his friend to buy the portrait. In fact,
Pellerin, abandoning the hope of being able to intimidate
him, had got round them so that they might use
their influence to obtain the thing for him.</p>

<p>Deslauriers spoke about it again, and pressed him
on the point, urging that the artist's claims were
reasonable.</p>

<p>"I am sure that for a sum of, perhaps, five hundred
francs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, give it to him! Wait! here it is!" said
Frederick.</p>

<p>The picture was brought the same evening. It appeared
to him a still more atrocious daub than when
he had seen it first. The half-tints and the shades
were darkened under the excessive retouchings, and
they seemed obscured when brought into relation with
the lights, which, having remained very brilliant here
and there, destroyed the harmony of the entire picture.</p>

<p>Frederick revenged himself for having had to pay
for it by bitterly disparaging it. Deslauriers believed
in Frederick's statement on the point, and expressed
approval of his conduct, for he had always been ambitious
of constituting a phalanx of which he would
be the leader. Certain men take delight in making
their friends do things which are disagreeable to
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Frederick did not renew his visits to
the Dambreuses. He lacked the capital for the investment.
He would have to enter into endless explanations
on the subject; he hesitated about making up
his mind. Perhaps he was in the right. Nothing was
certain now, the coal-mining speculation any more
than other things. He would have to give up society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of that sort. The end of the matter was that Deslauriers
was dissuaded from having anything further
to do with the undertaking.</p>

<p>From sheer force of hatred he had grown virtuous,
and again he preferred Frederick in a position of
mediocrity. In this way he remained his friend's
equal and in more intimate relationship with him.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Roque's commission had been very
badly executed. Her father wrote to him, supplying
him with the most precise directions, and concluded
his letter with this piece of foolery: "At the risk of
giving you <i>nigger on the brain</i>!"</p>

<p>Frederick could not do otherwise than call upon the
Arnouxs', once more. He went to the warehouse,
where he could see nobody. The firm being in a tottering
condition, the clerks imitated the carelessness
of their master.</p>

<p>He brushed against the shelves laden with earthenware,
which filled up the entire space in the centre
of the establishment; then, when he reached the lower
end, facing the counter, he walked with a more noisy
tread in order to make himself heard.</p>

<p>The porti&egrave;res parted, and Madame Arnoux appeared.</p>

<p>"What! you here! you!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she faltered, with some agitation. "I was
looking for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He saw her handkerchief near the desk, and
guessed that she had come down to her husband's
warehouse to have an account given to her as to the
business, to clear up some matter that caused her
anxiety.</p>

<p>"But perhaps there is something you want?" said
she.</p>

<p>"A mere nothing, madame."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"These shop-assistants are intolerable! they are always
out of the way."</p>

<p>They ought not to be blamed. On the contrary,
he congratulated himself on the circumstance.</p>

<p>She gazed at him in an ironical fashion.</p>

<p>"Well, and this marriage?"</p>

<p>"What marriage?"</p>

<p>"Your own!"</p>

<p>"Mine? I'll never marry as long as I live!"</p>

<p>She made a gesture as if to contradict his words.</p>

<p>"Though, indeed, such things must be, after all?
We take refuge in the commonplace, despairing of
ever realising the beautiful existence of which we have
dreamed."</p>

<p>"All your dreams, however, are not so&mdash;candid!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"When you drive to races with women!"</p>

<p>He cursed the Mar&eacute;chale. Then something recurred
to his memory.</p>

<p>"But it was you begged of me yourself to see her
at one time in the interest of Arnoux."</p>

<p>She replied with a shake of her head:</p>

<p>"And you take advantage of it to amuse yourself?"</p>

<p>"Good God! let us forget all these foolish things!"</p>

<p>"'Tis right, since you are going to be married."</p>

<p>And she stifled a sigh, while she bit her lips.</p>

<p>Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But I tell you again I am not! Can you believe
that I, with my intellectual requirements, my habits,
am going to bury myself in the provinces in order to
play cards, look after masons, and walk about in
wooden shoes? What object, pray, could I have for
taking such a step? You've been told that she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
rich, haven't you? Ah! what do I care about money?
Could I, after yearning long for that which is most
lovely, tender, enchanting, a sort of Paradise under a
human form, and having found this sweet ideal at last
when this vision hides every other from my view&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And taking her head between his two hands, he
began to kiss her on the eyelids, repeating:</p>

<p>"No! no! no! never will I marry! never! never!"</p>

<p>She submitted to these caresses, her mingled amazement
and delight having bereft her of the power of
motion.</p>

<p>The door of the storeroom above the staircase fell
back, and she remained with outstretched arms, as if
to bid him keep silence. Steps drew near. Then
some one said from behind the door:</p>

<p>"Is Madame there?"</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux had her elbow on the counter,
and was twisting about a pen between her fingers
quietly when the book-keeper threw aside the porti&egrave;re.</p>

<p>Frederick started up, as if on the point of leaving.</p>

<p>"Madame, I have the honour to salute you. The
set will be ready&mdash;will it not? I may count on
this?"</p>

<p>She made no reply. But by thus silently becoming
his accomplice in the deception, she made his
face flush with the crimson glow of adultery.</p>

<p>On the following day he paid her another visit.
She received him; and, in order to follow up the
advantage he had gained, Frederick immediately, without
any preamble, attempted to offer some justification
for the accidental meeting in the Champ de Mars.
It was the merest chance that led to his being in
that woman's company. While admitting that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
was pretty&mdash;which really was not the case&mdash;how
could she for even a moment absorb his thoughts,
seeing that he loved another woman?</p>

<p>"You know it well&mdash;I told you it was so!"</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux hung down her head.</p>

<p>"I am sorry you said such a thing."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The most ordinary proprieties now demand that
I should see you no more!"</p>

<p>He protested that his love was of an innocent
character. The past ought to be a guaranty as to his
future conduct. He had of his own accord made it a
point of honour with himself not to disturb her existence,
not to deafen her with his complaints.</p>

<p>"But yesterday my heart overflowed."</p>

<p>"We ought not to let our thoughts dwell on that
moment, my friend!"</p>

<p>And yet, where would be the harm in two wretched
beings mingling their griefs?</p>

<p>"For, indeed, you are not happy any more than
I am! Oh! I know you. You have no one who responds
to your craving for affection, for devotion. I
will do anything you wish! I will not offend you!
I swear to you that I will not!"</p>

<p>And he let himself fall on his knees, in spite of
himself, giving way beneath the weight of the feelings
that oppressed his heart.</p>

<p>"Rise!" she said; "I desire you to do so!"</p>

<p>And she declared in an imperious tone that if he
did not comply with her wish, she would never see
him again.</p>

<p>"Ha! I defy you to do it!" returned Frederick.
"What is there for me to do in the world? Other
men strive for riches, celebrity, power! But I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
no profession; you are my exclusive occupation, my
whole wealth, the object, the centre of my existence
and of my thoughts. I can no more live without
you than without the air of heaven! Do you not feel
the aspiration of my soul ascending towards yours,
and that they must intermingle, and that I am dying
on your account?"</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux began to tremble in every limb.</p>

<p>"Oh! leave me, I beg of you?"</p>

<p>The look of utter confusion in her face made him
pause. Then he advanced a step. But she drew
back, with her two hands clasped.</p>

<p>"Leave me in the name of Heaven, for mercy's
sake!"</p>

<p>And Frederick loved her so much that he went
away.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, he was filled with rage against
himself, declared in his own mind that he was an
idiot, and, after the lapse of twenty-four hours, returned.</p>

<p>Madame was not there. He remained at the head
of the stairs, stupefied with anger and indignation.
Arnoux appeared, and informed Frederick that his
wife had, that very morning, gone out to take up her
residence at a little country-house of which he had
become tenant at Auteuil, as he had given up possession
of the house at Saint-Cloud.</p>

<p>"This is another of her whims. No matter, as she
is settled at last; and myself, too, for that matter, so
much the better. Let us dine together this evening,
will you?"</p>

<p>Frederick pleaded as an excuse some urgent business;
then he hurried away of his own accord to
Auteuil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Arnoux allowed an exclamation of joy to
escape her lips. Then all his bitterness vanished.</p>

<p>He did not say one word about his love. In order
to inspire her with confidence in him, he even exaggerated
his reserve; and on his asking whether he might
call again, she replied: "Why, of course!" putting out
her hand, which she withdrew the next moment.</p>

<p>From that time forth, Frederick increased his
visits. He promised extra fares to the cabman who
drove him. But often he grew impatient at the slow
pace of the horse, and, alighting on the ground, he
would make a dash after an omnibus, and climb to
the top of it out of breath. Then with what disdain
he surveyed the faces of those around him, who were
not going to see her!</p>

<p>He could distinguish her house at a distance, with
an enormous honeysuckle covering, on one side, the
planks of the roof. It was a kind of Swiss ch&acirc;let,
painted red, with a balcony outside. In the garden
there were three old chestnut-trees, and on a rising
ground in the centre might be seen a parasol made
of thatch, held up by the trunk of a tree. Under the
slatework lining the walls, a big vine-tree, badly fastened,
hung from one place to another after the fashion
of a rotten cable. The gate-bell, which it was rather
hard to pull, was slow in ringing, and a long time
always elapsed before it was answered. On each occasion
he experienced a pang of suspense, a fear born
of irresolution.</p>

<p>Then his ears would be greeted with the pattering
of the servant-maid's slippers over the gravel, or else
Madame Arnoux herself would make her appearance.
One day he came up behind her just as she was
stooping down in the act of gathering violets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Her daughter's capricious disposition had made it
necessary to send the girl to a convent. Her little
son was at school every afternoon. Arnoux was now
in the habit of taking prolonged luncheons at the
Palais-Royal with Regimbart and their friend Compain.
They gave themselves no bother about anything
that occurred, no matter how disagreeable it
might be.</p>

<p>It was clearly understood between Frederick and her
that they should not belong to each other. By this
convention they were preserved from danger, and they
found it easier to pour out their hearts to each other.</p>

<p>She told him all about her early life at Chartres,
which she spent with her mother, her devotion when
she had reached her twelfth year, then her passion
for music, when she used to sing till nightfall in her
little room, from which the ramparts could be seen.</p>

<p>He related to her how melancholy broodings had
haunted him at college, and how a woman's face
shone brightly in the cloudland of his imagination, so
that, when he first laid eyes upon her, he felt that
her features were quite familiar to him.</p>

<p>These conversations, as a rule, covered only the
years during which they had been acquainted with
each other. He recalled to her recollection insignificant
details&mdash;the colour of her dress at a certain
period, a woman whom they had met on a certain
day, what she had said on another occasion; and she
replied, quite astonished:</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember!"</p>

<p>Their tastes, their judgments, were the same.
Often one of them, when listening to the other, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That's the way with me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>And the other replied:</p>

<p>"And with me, too!"</p>

<p>Then there were endless complaints about Providence:</p>

<p>"Why was it not the will of Heaven? If we had
only met&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Ah! if I had been younger!" she sighed.</p>

<p>"No, but if I had been a little older."</p>

<p>And they pictured to themselves a life entirely
given up to love, sufficiently rich to fill up the vastest
solitudes, surpassing all other joys, defying all forms
of wretchedness, in which the hours would glide
away in a continual outpouring of their own emotions,
and which would be as bright and glorious as
the palpitating splendour of the stars.</p>

<p>They were nearly always standing at the top of the
stairs exposed to the free air of heaven. The tops of
trees yellowed by the autumn raised their crests in front
of them at unequal heights up to the edge of the pale
sky; or else they walked on to the end of the avenue
into a summer-house whose only furniture was a couch
of grey canvas. Black specks stained the glass; the
walls exhaled a mouldy smell; and they remained
there chatting freely about all sorts of topics&mdash;anything
that happened to arise&mdash;in a spirit of hilarity.
Sometimes the rays of the sun, passing through the
Venetian blind, extended from the ceiling down to
the flagstones like the strings of a lyre. Particles of
dust whirled amid these luminous bars. She amused
herself by dividing them with her hand. Frederick
gently caught hold of her; and he gazed on the
twinings of her veins, the grain of her skin, and the
form of her fingers. Each of those fingers of hers
was for him more than a thing&mdash;almost a person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave him her gloves, and, the week after, her
handkerchief. She called him "Frederick;" he called
her "Marie," adoring this name, which, as he said,
was expressly made to be uttered with a sigh of
ecstasy, and which seemed to contain clouds of incense
and scattered heaps of roses.</p>

<p>They soon came to an understanding as to the
days on which he would call to see her; and, leaving
the house as if by mere chance, she walked
along the road to meet him.</p>

<p>She made no effort whatever to excite his love,
lost in that listlessness which is characteristic of intense
happiness. During the whole season she wore
a brown silk dressing-gown with velvet borders of the
same colour, a large garment, which united the indolence
of her attitudes and her grave physiognomy.
Besides, she had just reached the autumnal period of
womanhood, in which reflection is combined with
tenderness, in which the beginning of maturity
colours the face with a more intense flame, when
strength of feeling mingles with experience of life,
and when, having completely expanded, the entire
being overflows with a richness in harmony with
its beauty. Never had she possessed more sweetness,
more leniency. Secure in the thought that
she would not err, she abandoned herself to a sentiment
which seemed to her won by her sorrows.
And, moreover, it was so innocent and fresh! What
an abyss lay between the coarseness of Arnoux and
the adoration of Frederick!</p>

<p>He trembled at the thought that by an imprudent
word he might lose all that he had gained, saying to
himself that an opportunity might be found again,
but that a foolish step could never be repaired. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
wished that she should give herself rather than that
he should take her. The assurance of being loved
by her delighted him like a foretaste of possession,
and then the charm of her person troubled his heart
more than his senses. It was an indefinable feeling
of bliss, a sort of intoxication that made him lose
sight of the possibility of having his happiness completed.
Apart from her, he was consumed with
longing.</p>

<p>Ere long the conversations were interrupted by
long spells of silence. Sometimes a species of sexual
shame made them blush in each other's presence.
All the precautions they took to hide their love only
unveiled it; the stronger it grew, the more constrained
they became in manner. The effect of this
dissimulation was to intensify their sensibility. They
experienced a sensation of delight at the odour of
moist leaves; they could not endure the east wind;
they got irritated without any apparent cause, and
had melancholy forebodings. The sound of a footstep,
the creaking of the wainscoting, filled them
with as much terror as if they had been guilty.
They felt as if they were being pushed towards the
edge of a chasm. They were surrounded by a tempestuous
atmosphere; and when complaints escaped
Frederick's lips, she made accusations against herself.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am doing wrong. I am acting as if I
were a coquette! Don't come any more!"</p>

<p>Then he would repeat the same oaths, to which
on each occasion she listened with renewed pleasure.</p>

<p>His return to Paris, and the fuss occasioned by
New Year's Day, interrupted their meetings to some
extent. When he returned, he had an air of greater
self-confidence. Every moment she went out to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
orders, and in spite of his entreaties she received
every visitor that called during the evening.</p>

<p>After this, they engaged in conversations about
L&eacute;otade, M. Guizot, the Pope, the insurrection at Palermo,
and the banquet of the Twelfth Arrondissement,
which had caused some disquietude. Frederick eased
his mind by railing against Power, for he longed,
like Deslauriers, to turn the whole world upside down,
so soured had he now become. Madame Arnoux, on
her side, had become sad.</p>

<p>Her husband, indulging in displays of wild folly,
was flirting with one of the girls in his pottery
works, the one who was known as "the girl from
Bordeaux." Madame Arnoux was herself informed
about it by Frederick. He wanted to make use of it
as an argument, "inasmuch as she was the victim of
deception."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm not much concerned about it," she
said.</p>

<p>This admission on her part seemed to him to
strengthen the intimacy between them. Would Arnoux
be seized with mistrust with regard to them?</p>

<p>"No! not now!"</p>

<p>She told him that, one evening, he had left them
talking together, and had afterwards come back again
and listened behind the door, and as they both were
chatting at the time of matters that were of no consequence,
he had lived since then in a state of complete
security.</p>

<p>"With good reason, too&mdash;is that not so?" said
Frederick bitterly.</p>

<p>"Yes, no doubt!"</p>

<p>It would have been better for him not to have
given so risky an answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>One day she was not at home at the hour when
he usually called. To him there seemed to be a sort
of treason in this.</p>

<p>He was next displeased at seeing the flowers
which he used to bring her always placed in a glass
of water.</p>

<p>"Where, then, would you like me to put them?"</p>

<p>"Oh! not there! However, they are not so cold
there as they would be near your heart!"</p>

<p>Not long afterwards he reproached her for having
been at the Italian opera the night before without
having given him a previous intimation of her intention
to go there. Others had seen, admired, fallen in
love with her, perhaps; Frederick was fastening on
those suspicions of his merely in order to pick a
quarrel with her, to torment her; for he was beginning
to hate her, and the very least he might expect
was that she should share in his sufferings!</p>

<p>One afternoon, towards the middle of February, he
surprised her in a state of great mental excitement.
Eug&egrave;ne had been complaining about his sore throat.
The doctor had told her, however, that it was a
trifling ailment&mdash;a bad cold, an attack of influenza.
Frederick was astonished at the child's stupefied look.
Nevertheless, he reassured the mother, and brought
forward the cases of several children of the same age
who had been attacked with similar ailments, and had
been speedily cured.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, assuredly!"</p>

<p>"Oh! how good you are!"</p>

<p>And she caught his hand. He clasped hers tightly
in his.</p>

<p>"Oh! let it go!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does it signify, when it is to one who
sympathises with you that you offer it? You place
every confidence in me when I speak of these things,
but you distrust me when I talk to you about my
love!"</p>

<p>"I don't doubt you on that point, my poor friend!"</p>

<p>"Why this distrust, as if I were a wretch capable
of abusing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! no!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>"If I had only a proof!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>"What proof?"</p>

<p>"The proof that a person might give to the first
comer&mdash;what you have granted to myself!"</p>

<p>And he recalled to her recollection how, on one
occasion, they had gone out together, on a winter's
twilight, when there was a fog. This seemed now
a long time ago. What, then, was to prevent her
from showing herself on his arm before the whole
world without any fear on her part, and without any
mental reservation on his, not having anyone around
them who could importune them?</p>

<p>"Be it so!" she said, with a promptness of decision
that at first astonished Frederick.</p>

<p>But he replied, in a lively fashion:</p>

<p>"Would you like me to wait at the corner of the
Rue Tronchet and the Rue de la Ferme?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, my friend!" faltered Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>Without giving her time to reflect, he added:</p>

<p>"Next Tuesday, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Tuesday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, between two and three o'clock."</p>

<p>"I will be there!"</p>

<p>And she turned aside her face with a movement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of shame. Frederick placed his lips on the nape of
her neck.</p>

<p>"Oh! this is not right," she said. "You will
make me repent."</p>

<p>He turned away, dreading the fickleness which is
customary with women. Then, on the threshold, he
murmured softly, as if it were a thing that was
thoroughly understood:</p>

<p>"On Tuesday!"</p>

<p>She lowered her beautiful eyes in a cautious and
resigned fashion.</p>

<p>Frederick had a plan arranged in his mind.</p>

<p>He hoped that, owing to the rain or the sun, he
might get her to stop under some doorway, and that,
once there, she would go into some house. The difficulty
was to find one that would suit.</p>

<p>He made a search, and about the middle of the
Rue Tronchet he read, at a distance on a signboard,
"Furnished apartments."</p>

<p>The waiter, divining his object, showed him immediately
above the ground-floor a room and a closet
with two exits. Frederick took it for a month, and
paid in advance. Then he went into three shops to
buy the rarest perfumery. He got a piece of imitation
guipure, which was to replace the horrible red
cotton foot-coverlets; he selected a pair of blue satin
slippers, only the fear of appearing coarse checked
the amount of his purchases. He came back with
them; and with more devotion than those who are
erecting processional altars, he altered the position of
the furniture, arranged the curtains himself, put
heather in the fireplace, and covered the chest of
drawers with violets. He would have liked to pave
the entire apartment with gold. "To-morrow is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
time," said he to himself. "Yes, to-morrow! I am
not dreaming!" and he felt his heart throbbing violently
under the delirious excitement begotten by his
anticipations. Then, when everything was ready, he
carried off the key in his pocket, as if the happiness
which slept there might have flown away along
with it.</p>

<p>A letter from his mother was awaiting him when
he reached his abode:</p>

<p>"Why such a long absence? Your conduct is
beginning to look ridiculous. I understand your hesitating
more or less at first with regard to this union.
However, think well upon it."</p>

<p>And she put the matter before him with the utmost
clearness: an income of forty-five thousand
francs. However, "people were talking about it;" and
M. Roque was waiting for a definite answer. As for
the young girl, her position was truly most embarrassing.</p>

<p>"She is deeply attached to you."</p>

<p>Frederick threw aside the letter even before he
had finished reading it, and opened another epistle
which came from Deslauriers.</p>

<p>"Dear Old Boy,&mdash;The <i>pear</i> is ripe. In accordance
with your promise, we may count on you. We
meet to-morrow at daybreak, in the Place du Panth&eacute;on.
Drop into the Caf&eacute; Soufflot. It is necessary
for me to have a chat with you before the manifestation
takes place."</p>

<p>"Oh! I know them, with their manifestations! A
thousand thanks! I have a more agreeable appointment."</p>

<p>And on the following morning, at eleven o'clock,
Frederick had left the house. He wanted to give one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
last glance at the preparations. Then, who could tell
but that, by some chance or other, she might be at
the place of meeting before him? As he emerged
from the Rue Tronchet, he heard a great clamour behind
the Madeleine. He pressed forward, and saw at
the far end of the square, to the left, a number of
men in blouses and well-dressed people.</p>

<p>In fact, a manifesto published in the newspapers
had summoned to this spot all who had subscribed
to the banquet of the Reform Party. The Ministry
had, almost without a moment's delay, posted up a
proclamation prohibiting the meeting. The Parliamentary
Opposition had, on the previous evening,
disclaimed any connection with it; but the patriots,
who were unaware of this resolution on the part of
their leaders, had come to the meeting-place, followed
by a great crowd of spectators. A deputation from
the schools had made its way, a short time before,
to the house of Odillon Barrot. It was now at the
residence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs; and nobody
could tell whether the banquet would take
place, whether the Government would carry out its
threat, and whether the National Guards would make
their appearance. People were as much enraged
against the deputies as against Power. The crowd
was growing bigger and bigger, when suddenly the
strains of the "Marseillaise" rang through the air.</p>

<p>It was the students' column which had just arrived
on the scene. They marched along at an ordinary
walking pace, in double file and in good order, with
angry faces, bare hands, and all exclaiming at intervals:</p>

<p>"Long live Reform! Down with Guizot!"</p>

<p>Frederick's friends were there, sure enough. They
would have noticed him and dragged him along with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
them. He quickly sought refuge in the Rue de l'Arcade.</p>

<p>When the students had taken two turns round
the Madeleine, they went down in the direction of
the Place de la Concorde. It was full of people; and,
at a distance, the crowd pressed close together, had
the appearance of a field of dark ears of corn swaying
to and fro.</p>

<p>At the same moment, some soldiers of the line
ranged themselves in battle-array at the left-hand side
of the church.</p>

<p>The groups remained standing there, however. In
order to put an end to this, some police-officers in
civilian dress seized the most riotous of them in a
brutal fashion, and carried them off to the guard-house.
Frederick, in spite of his indignation, remained
silent; he might have been arrested along with the
others, and he would have missed Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>A little while afterwards the helmets of the Municipal
Guards appeared. They kept striking about
them with the flat side of their sabres. A horse fell
down. The people made a rush forward to save
him, and as soon as the rider was in the saddle, they
all ran away.</p>

<p>Then there was a great silence. The thin rain,
which had moistened the asphalt, was no longer falling.
Clouds floated past, gently swept on by the
west wind.</p>

<p>Frederick began running through the Rue Tronchet,
looking before him and behind him.</p>

<p>At length it struck two o'clock.</p>

<p>"Ha! now is the time!" said he to himself. "She
is leaving her house; she is approaching," and a
minute after, "she would have had time to be here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to three he tried to keep quiet. "No, she is
not going to be late&mdash;a little patience!"</p>

<p>And for want of something to do he examined the
most interesting shops that he passed&mdash;a bookseller's,
a saddler's and a mourning warehouse. Soon he
knew the names of the different books, the various
kinds of harness, and every sort of material. The
persons who looked after these establishments, from
seeing him continually going backwards and forwards,
were at first surprised, and then alarmed, and
they closed up their shop-fronts.</p>

<p>No doubt she had met with some impediment,
and for that reason she must be enduring pain on account
of it. But what delight would be afforded in
a very short time! For she would come&mdash;that was
certain. "She has given me her promise!" In the
meantime an intolerable feeling of anxiety was gradually
seizing hold of him. Impelled by an absurd idea,
he returned to his hotel, as if he expected to find her
there. At the same moment, she might have reached
the street in which their meeting was to take place.
He rushed out. Was there no one? And he resumed
his tramp up and down the footpath.</p>

<p>He stared at the gaps in the pavement, the mouths
of the gutters, the candelabra, and the numbers above
the doors. The most trifling objects became for him
companions, or rather, ironical spectators, and the
regular fronts of the houses seemed to him to have a
pitiless aspect. He was suffering from cold feet. He
felt as if he were about to succumb to the dejection
which was crushing him. The reverberation of his
footsteps vibrated through his brain.</p>

<p>When he saw by his watch that it was four
o'clock, he experienced, as it were, a sense of vertigo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a feeling of dismay. He tried to repeat some verses
to himself, to enter on a calculation, no matter of
what sort, to invent some kind of story. Impossible!
He was beset by the image of Madame Arnoux; he
felt a longing to run in order to meet her. But what
road ought he to take so that they might not pass
each other?</p>

<p>He went up to a messenger, put five francs into his
hand, and ordered him to go to the Rue de Paradis
to Jacques Arnoux's residence to enquire "if Madame
were at home." Then he took up his post at the
corner of the Rue de la Ferme and of the Rue Tronchet,
so as to be able to look down both of them at
the same time. On the boulevard, in the background
of the scene in front of him, confused masses of people
were gliding past. He could distinguish, every
now and then, the aigrette of a dragoon or a
woman's hat; and he strained his eyes in the effort
to recognise the wearer. A child in rags, exhibiting
a jack-in-the-box, asked him, with a smile, for alms.</p>

<p>The man with the velvet vest reappeared. "The
porter had not seen her going out." What had kept
her in? If she were ill he would have been told
about it. Was it a visitor? Nothing was easier than
to say that she was not at home. He struck his
forehead.</p>

<p>"Ah! I am stupid! Of course, 'tis this political
outbreak that prevented her from coming!"</p>

<p>He was relieved by this apparently natural explanation.
Then, suddenly: "But her quarter of the
city is quiet." And a horrible doubt seized hold of
his mind: "Suppose she was not coming at all, and
merely gave me a promise in order to get rid of
me? No, no!" What had prevented her from com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ing
was, no doubt, some extraordinary mischance,
one of those occurrences that baffled all one's anticipations.
In that case she would have written to him.</p>

<p>And he sent the hotel errand-boy to his residence
in the Rue Rumfort to find out whether there happened
to be a letter waiting for him there.</p>

<p>No letter had been brought. This absence of news
reassured him.</p>

<p>He drew omens from the number of coins which
he took up in his hand out of his pocket by chance,
from the physiognomies of the passers-by, and from
the colour of different horses; and when the augury
was unfavourable, he forced himself to disbelieve in
it. In his sudden outbursts of rage against Madame
Arnoux, he abused her in muttering tones. Then
came fits of weakness that nearly made him swoon,
followed, all of a sudden, by fresh rebounds of hopefulness.
She would make her appearance presently!
She was there, behind his back! He turned round&mdash;there
was nobody there! Once he perceived, about
thirty paces away, a woman of the same height, with
a dress of the same kind. He came up to her&mdash;it
was not she. It struck five&mdash;half-past five&mdash;six.
The gas-lamps were lighted, Madame Arnoux had
not come.</p>

<p>The night before, she had dreamed that she had
been, for some time, on the footpath in the Rue
Tronchet. She was waiting there for something the
nature of which she was not quite clear about, but
which, nevertheless, was of great importance; and,
without knowing why, she was afraid of being seen.
But a pestiferous little dog kept barking at her furiously
and biting at the hem of her dress. Every
time she shook him off he returned stubbornly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the attack, always barking more violently than before.
Madame Arnoux woke up. The dog's barking
continued. She strained her ears to listen. It came
from her son's room. She rushed to the spot in her
bare feet. It was the child himself who was coughing.
His hands were burning, his face flushed, and
his voice singularly hoarse. Every minute he found
it more difficult to breathe freely. She waited there
till daybreak, bent over the coverlet watching him.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the drum of the National Guard
gave warning to M. Arnoux that his comrades were
expecting his arrival. He dressed himself quickly
and went away, promising that he would immediately
be passing the house of their doctor, M. Colot.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, when M. Colot did not make his
appearance, Madame Arnoux despatched her chambermaid
for him. The doctor was away in the country;
and the young man who was taking his place had
gone out on some business.</p>

<p>Eug&egrave;ne kept his head on one side on the bolster
with contracted eyebrows and dilated nostrils. His
pale little face had become whiter than the sheets;
and there escaped from his larynx a wheezing caused
by his oppressed breathing, which became gradually
shorter, dryer, and more metallic. His cough resembled
the noise made by those barbarous mechanical
inventions by which toy-dogs are enabled to bark.</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux was seized with terror. She
rang the bell violently, calling out for help, and exclaiming:</p>

<p>"A doctor! a doctor!"</p>

<p>Ten minutes later came an elderly gentleman in a
white tie, and with grey whiskers well trimmed.
He put several questions as to the habits, the age,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and the constitution of the young patient, and studied
the case with his head thrown back. He next wrote
out a prescription.</p>

<p>The calm manner of this old man was intolerable.
He smelt of aromatics. She would have liked to
beat him. He said he would come back in the evening.</p>

<p>The horrible coughing soon began again. Sometimes
the child arose suddenly. Convulsive movements
shook the muscles of his breast; and in his
efforts to breathe his stomach shrank in as if he
were suffocating after running too hard. Then he
sank down, with his head thrown back and his mouth
wide open. With infinite pains, Madame Arnoux
tried to make him swallow the contents of the phials,
hippo wine, and a potion containing trisulphate of
antimony. But he pushed away the spoon, groaning
in a feeble voice. He seemed to be blowing out his
words.</p>

<p>From time to time she re-read the prescription.
The observations of the formulary frightened her.
Perhaps the apothecary had made some mistake. Her
powerlessness filled her with despair. M. Colot's pupil
arrived.</p>

<p>He was a young man of modest demeanour, new
to medical work, and he made no attempt to disguise
his opinion about the case. He was at first undecided
as to what he should do, for fear of compromising
himself, and finally he ordered pieces of ice
to be applied to the sick child. It took a long time
to get ice. The bladder containing the ice burst. It
was necessary to change the little boy's shirt. This
disturbance brought on an attack of even a more
dreadful character than any of the previous ones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The child began tearing off the linen round his
neck, as if he wanted to remove the obstacle that
was choking him; and he scratched the walls and
seized the curtains of his bedstead, trying to get a
point of support to assist him in breathing.</p>

<p>His face was now of a bluish hue, and his entire
body, steeped in a cold perspiration, appeared to be
growing lean. His haggard eyes were fixed with
terror on his mother. He threw his arms round her
neck, and hung there in a desperate fashion; and, repressing
her rising sobs, she gave utterance in a
broken voice to loving words:</p>

<p>"Yes, my pet, my angel, my treasure!"</p>

<p>Then came intervals of calm.</p>

<p>She went to look for playthings&mdash;a punchinello,
a collection of images, and spread them out on the
bed in order to amuse him. She even made an attempt
to sing.</p>

<p>She began to sing a little ballad which she used
to sing years before, when she was nursing him
wrapped up in swaddling-clothes in this same little
upholstered chair. But a shiver ran all over his frame,
just as when a wave is agitated by the wind. The
balls of his eyes protruded. She thought he was going
to die, and turned away her eyes to avoid seeing
him.</p>

<p>The next moment she felt strength enough in her to
look at him. He was still living. The hours succeeded
each other&mdash;dull, mournful, interminable,
hopeless, and she no longer counted the minutes,
save by the progress of this mental anguish. The
shakings of his chest threw him forward as if to shatter
his body. Finally, he vomited something strange,
which was like a parchment tube. What was this?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
She fancied that he had evacuated one end of his
entrails. But he now began to breathe freely and
regularly. This appearance of well-being frightened
her more than anything else that had happened. She
was sitting like one petrified, her arms hanging by her
sides, her eyes fixed, when M. Colot suddenly made
his appearance. The child, in his opinion, was saved.</p>

<p>She did not realise what he meant at first, and
made him repeat the words. Was not this one of
those consoling phrases which were customary with
medical men? The doctor went away with an air of
tranquillity. Then it seemed as if the cords that
pressed round her heart were loosened.</p>

<p>"Saved! Is this possible?"</p>

<p>Suddenly the thought of Frederick presented itself
to her mind in a clear and inexorable fashion. It was
a warning sent to her by Providence. But the Lord
in His mercy had not wished to complete her chastisement.
What expiation could she offer hereafter if
she were to persevere in this love-affair? No doubt
insults would be flung at her son's head on her
account; and Madame Arnoux saw him a young
man, wounded in a combat, carried off on a litter,
dying. At one spring she threw herself on the little
chair, and, letting her soul escape towards the heights
of heaven, she vowed to God that she would sacrifice,
as a holocaust, her first real passion, her only weakness
as a woman.</p>

<p>Frederick had returned home. He remained in his
armchair, without even possessing enough of energy to
curse her. A sort of slumber fell upon him, and, in the
midst of his nightmare, he could hear the rain falling,
still under the impression that he was there outside
on the footpath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, yielding to an incapacity to resist
the temptation which clung to him, he again sent a
messenger to Madame Arnoux's house.</p>

<p>Whether the true explanation happened to be that
the fellow did not deliver his message, or that she
had too many things to say to explain herself in a
word or two, the same answer was brought back.
This insolence was too great! A feeling of angry
pride took possession of him. He swore in his own
mind that he would never again cherish even a desire;
and, like a group of leaves carried away by a hurricane,
his love disappeared. He experienced a sense
of relief, a feeling of stoical joy, then a need of violent
action; and he walked on at random through the
streets.</p>

<p>Men from the faubourgs were marching past armed
with guns and old swords, some of them wearing red
caps, and all singing the "Marseillaise" or the "Girondins."
Here and there a National Guard was hurrying
to join his mayoral department. Drums could
be heard rolling in the distance. A conflict was going
on at Porte Saint-Martin. There was something
lively and warlike in the air. Frederick kept walking
on without stopping. The excitement of the great
city made him gay.</p>

<p>On the Frascati hill he got a glimpse of the Mar&eacute;chale's
windows: a wild idea occurred to him, a reaction
of youthfulness. He crossed the boulevard.</p>

<p>The yard-gate was just being closed; and Delphine,
who was in the act of writing on it with a piece of
charcoal, "Arms given," said to him in an eager
tone:</p>

<p>"Ah! Madame is in a nice state! She dismissed a
groom who insulted her this morning. She thinks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
there's going to be pillage everywhere. She is frightened
to death! and the more so as Monsieur has
gone!"</p>

<p>"What Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"The Prince!"</p>

<p>Frederick entered the boudoir. The Mar&eacute;chale appeared
in her petticoat, and her hair hanging down
her back in disorder.</p>

<p><a name="saveme" id="saveme">"Ah! thanks! You are going to save me!</a> 'tis the
second time! You are one of those who never count
the cost!"</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons!" said Frederick, catching
her round the waist with both hands.</p>

<p>"How now? What are you doing?" stammered
the Mar&eacute;chale, at the same time, surprised and cheered
up by his manner.</p>

<p>He replied:</p>

<p>"I am the fashion! I'm reformed!"</p>

<p>She let herself fall back on the divan, and continued
laughing under his kisses.</p>

<p>They spent the afternoon looking out through the
window at the people in the street. Then he brought
her to dine at the Trois Fr&egrave;res Proven&ccedil;aux. The
meal was a long and dainty one. They came back
on foot for want of a vehicle.</p>

<p>At the announcement of a change of Ministry,
Paris had changed. Everyone was in a state of delight.
People kept promenading about the streets, and
every floor was illuminated with lamps, so that it
seemed as if it were broad daylight. The soldiers
made their way back to their barracks, worn out and
looking quite depressed. The people saluted them
with exclamations of "Long live the Line!"</p>

<p>They went on without making any response.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Among the National Guard, on the contrary, the
officers, flushed with enthusiasm, brandished their
sabres, vociferating:</p>

<p>"Long live Reform!"</p>

<p>And every time the two lovers heard this word
they laughed.</p>

<p>Frederick told droll stories, and was quite gay.</p>

<p>Making their way through the Rue Duphot, they
reached the boulevards. Venetian lanterns hanging
from the houses formed wreaths of flame. Underneath,
a confused swarm of people kept in constant
motion. In the midst of those moving shadows could
be seen, here and there, the steely glitter of bayonets.
There was a great uproar. The crowd was too compact,
and it was impossible to make one's way back
in a straight line. They were entering the Rue Caumartin,
when suddenly there burst forth behind them
a noise like the crackling made by an immense piece
of silk in the act of being torn across. It was the
discharge of musketry on the Boulevard des Capucines.</p>

<p>"Ha! a few of the citizens are getting a crack,"
said Frederick calmly; for there are situations in
which a man of the least cruel disposition is so much
detached from his fellow-men that he would see the
entire human race perishing without a single throb of
the heart.</p>

<p>The Mar&eacute;chale was clinging to his arm with her
teeth chattering. She declared that she would not be
able to walk twenty steps further. Then, by a refinement
of hatred, in order the better to offer an
outrage in his own soul to Madame Arnoux, he led
Rosanette to the hotel in the Rue Tronchet, and
brought her up to the room which he had got ready
for the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The flowers were not withered. The guipure was
spread out on the bed. He drew forth from the cupboard
the little slippers. Rosanette considered this
forethought on his part a great proof of his delicacy
of sentiment. About one o'clock she was awakened
by distant rolling sounds, and she saw that he was
sobbing with his head buried in the pillow.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you now, my own
darling?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the excess of happiness," said Frederick.
"I have been too long yearning after you!"</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="chapter_xiv" id="chapter_xiv"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">The Barricade.</h3>


<p><img src="images/i_chxiv.png" width="123" height="125" alt="H" title="" class="illodrop" style="margin-top: -3.5em;" />e was abruptly roused from sleep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
by the noise of a discharge of
musketry; and, in spite of Rosanette's
entreaties, Frederick was
fully determined to go and see
what was happening. He hurried
down to the Champs-Elys&eacute;es, from which shots were
being fired. At the corner of the Rue Saint-Honor&eacute;
some men in blouses ran past him, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"No! not that way! to the Palais-Royal!"</p>

<p>Frederick followed them. The grating of the Convent
of the Assumption had been torn away. A little
further on he noticed three paving-stones in the middle
of the street, the beginning of a barricade, no
doubt; then fragments of bottles and bundles of iron-wire,
to obstruct the cavalry; and, at the same
moment, there rushed suddenly out of a lane a tall
young man of pale complexion, with his black hair
flowing over his shoulders, and with a sort of pea-coloured
swaddling-cloth thrown round him. In his
hand he held a long military musket, and he dashed
along on the tips of his slippers with the air of a somnambulist
and with the nimbleness of a tiger. At intervals
a detonation could be heard.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>On the evening of the day before, the spectacle of
the wagon containing five corpses picked up from
amongst those that were lying on the Boulevard des
Capucines had charged the disposition of the people;
and, while at the Tuileries the aides-de-camp succeeded
each other, and M. Mol&eacute;, having set about
the composition of a new Cabinet, did not come
back, and M. Thiers was making efforts to constitute
another, and while the King was cavilling and hesitating,
and finally assigned the post of commander-in-chief
to Bugeaud in order to prevent him from
making use of it, the insurrection was organising
itself in a formidable manner, as if it were directed
by a single arm.</p>

<p>Men endowed with a kind of frantic eloquence
were engaged in haranguing the populace at the street-corners,
others were in the churches ringing the tocsin
as loudly as ever they could. Lead was cast for
bullets, cartridges were rolled about. The trees on
the boulevards, the urinals, the benches, the gratings,
the gas-burners, everything was torn off and thrown
down. Paris, that morning, was covered with barricades.
The resistance which was offered was of short
duration, so that at eight o'clock the people, by voluntary
surrender or by force, had got possession of
five barracks, nearly all the municipal buildings, the
most favourable strategic points. Of its own accord,
without any effort, the Monarchy was melting away
in rapid dissolution, and now an attack was made on
the guard-house of the Ch&acirc;teau d'Eau, in order to
liberate fifty prisoners, who were not there.</p>

<p>Frederick was forced to stop at the entrance to
the square. It was filled with groups of armed men.
The Rue Saint-Thomas and the Rue Fromanteau were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
occupied by companies of the Line. The Rue de
Valois was choked up by an enormous barricade.
The smoke which fluttered about at the top of it
partly opened. Men kept running overhead, making
violent gestures; they vanished from sight; then the
firing was again renewed. It was answered from the
guard-house without anyone being seen inside. Its
windows, protected by oaken window-shutters, were
pierced with loop-holes; and the monument with its
two storys, its two wings, its fountain on the first
floor and its little door in the centre, was beginning
to be speckled with white spots under the shock of
the bullets. The three steps in front of it remained
unoccupied.</p>

<p>At Frederick's side a man in a Greek cap, with a
cartridge-box over his knitted vest, was holding a dispute
with a woman with a Madras neckerchief round
her shoulders. She said to him:</p>

<p>"Come back now! Come back!"</p>

<p>"Leave me alone!" replied the husband. "You
can easily mind the porter's lodge by yourself. I ask,
citizen, is this fair? I have on every occasion done
my duty&mdash;in 1830, in '32, in '34, and in '39! To-day
they're fighting again. I must fight! Go away!"</p>

<p>And the porter's wife ended by yielding to his
remonstrances and to those of a National Guard near
them&mdash;a man of forty, whose simple face was adorned
with a circle of white beard. He loaded his gun and
fired while talking to Frederick, as cool in the midst
of the outbreak as a horticulturist in his garden. A
young lad with a packing-cloth thrown over him was
trying to coax this man to give him a few caps, so that
he might make use of a gun he had, a fine fowling-piece
which a "gentleman" had made him a present of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Catch on behind my back," said the good man,
"and keep yourself from being seen, or you'll get
yourself killed!"</p>

<p>The drums beat for the charge. Sharp cries, hurrahs
of triumph burst forth. A continual ebbing to
and fro made the multitude sway backward and forward.
Frederick, caught between two thick masses
of people, did not move an inch, all the time fascinated
and exceedingly amused by the scene around
him. The wounded who sank to the ground, the
dead lying at his feet, did not seem like persons
really wounded or really dead. The impression left
on his mind was that he was looking on at a show.</p>

<p>In the midst of the surging throng, above the sea
of heads, could be seen an old man in a black coat,
mounted on a white horse with a velvet saddle. He
held in one hand a green bough, in the other a paper,
and he kept shaking them persistently; but at
length, giving up all hope of obtaining a hearing, he
withdrew from the scene.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the Line had gone, and only the
municipal troops remained to defend the guard-house.
A wave of dauntless spirits dashed up the steps; they
were flung down; others came on to replace them,
and the gate resounded under blows from iron bars.
The municipal guards did not give way. But a
wagon, stuffed full of hay, and burning like a gigantic
torch, was dragged against the walls. Faggots were
speedily brought, then straw, and a barrel of spirits
of wine. The fire mounted up to the stones along
the wall; the building began to send forth smoke on
all sides like the crater of a volcano; and at its summit,
between the balustrades of the terrace, huge
flames escaped with a harsh noise. The first story of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the Palais-Royal was occupied by National Guards.
Shots were fired through every window in the square;
the bullets whizzed, the water of the fountain, which
had burst, was mingled with the blood, forming little
pools on the ground. People slipped in the mud over
clothes, shakos, and weapons. Frederick felt something
soft under his foot. It was the hand of a sergeant
in a grey great-coat, lying on his face in the
stream that ran along the street. Fresh bands of people
were continually coming up, pushing on the combatants
at the guard-house. The firing became quicker.
The wine-shops were open; people went into them
from time to time to smoke a pipe and drink a glass
of beer, and then came back again to fight. A lost
dog began to howl. This made the people laugh.</p>

<p>Frederick was shaken by the impact of a man
falling on his shoulder with a bullet through his back
and the death-rattle in his throat. At this shot, perhaps
directed against himself, he felt himself stirred
up to rage; and he was plunging forward when a
National Guard stopped him.</p>

<p>"'Tis useless! the King has just gone! Ah! if you
don't believe me, go and see for yourself!"</p>

<p>This assurance calmed Frederick. The Place du
Carrousel had a tranquil aspect. The H&ocirc;tel de Nantes
stood there as fixed as ever; and the houses in the
rear; the dome of the Louvre in front, the long gallery
of wood at the right, and the waste plot of
ground that ran unevenly as far as the sheds of the
stall-keepers were, so to speak, steeped in the grey hues
of the atmosphere, where indistinct murmurs seemed to
mingle with the fog; while, at the opposite side of the
square, a stiff light, falling through the parting of
the clouds on the fa&ccedil;ade of the Tuileries, cut out all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
its windows into white patches. Near the Arc de
Triomphe a dead horse lay on the ground. Behind
the gratings groups consisting of five or six persons
were chatting. The doors leading into the ch&acirc;teau
were open, and the servants at the thresholds allowed
the people to enter.</p>

<p>Below stairs, in a kind of little parlour, bowls of
<i>caf&eacute; au lait</i> were handed round. A few of those
present sat down to the table and made merry;
others remained standing, and amongst the latter was
a hackney-coachman. He snatched up with both
hands a glass vessel full of powdered sugar, cast a
restless glance right and left, and then began to eat
voraciously, with his nose stuck into the mouth of
the vessel.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the great staircase a man was
writing his name in a register.</p>

<p>Frederick was able to recognise him by his back.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Hussonnet!"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'tis I," replied the Bohemian. "I am introducing
myself at court. This is a nice joke, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we go upstairs?"</p>

<p>And they reached presently the Salle des Mar&eacute;chaux.
The portraits of those illustrious generals, save that of
Bugeaud, which had been pierced through the stomach,
were all intact. They were represented leaning on
their sabres with a gun-carriage behind each of them,
and in formidable attitudes in contrast with the occasion.
A large timepiece proclaimed it was twenty
minutes past one.</p>

<p>Suddenly the "Marseillaise" resounded. Hussonnet
and Frederick bent over the balusters. It was the
people. They rushed up the stairs, shaking with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
dizzying, wave-like motion bare heads, or helmets, or
red caps, or else bayonets or human shoulders with
such impetuosity that some people disappeared every
now and then in this swarming mass, which was
mounting up without a moment's pause, like a river
compressed by an equinoctial tide, with a continuous
roar under an irresistible impulse. When they got to
the top of the stairs, they were scattered, and their
chant died away. Nothing could any longer be heard
but the tramp of all the shoes intermingled with the
chopping sound of many voices. The crowd not
being in a mischievous mood, contented themselves
with looking about them. But, from time to time,
an elbow, by pressing too hard, broke through a
pane of glass, or else a vase or a statue rolled from
a bracket down on the floor. The wainscotings
cracked under the pressure of people against them.
Every face was flushed; the perspiration was rolling
down their features in large beads. Hussonnet made
this remark:</p>

<p>"Heroes have not a good smell."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are provoking," returned Frederick.</p>

<p>And, pushed forward in spite of themselves, they
entered an apartment in which a dais of red velvet
rose as far as the ceiling. On the throne below sat
a representative of the proletariat in effigy with a
black beard, his shirt gaping open, a jolly air, and the
stupid look of a baboon. Others climbed up the platform
to sit in his place.</p>

<p>"What a myth!" said Hussonnet. "There you see
the sovereign people!"</p>

<p>The armchair was lifted up on the hands of a number
of persons and passed across the hall, swaying
from one side to the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"By Jove, 'tis like a boat! The Ship of State is
tossing about in a stormy sea! Let it dance the cancan!
Let it dance the cancan!"</p>

<p>They had drawn it towards a window, and in the
midst of hisses, they launched it out.</p>

<p>"Poor old chap!" said Hussonnet, as he saw the
effigy falling into the garden, where it was speedily
picked up in order to be afterwards carried to the
Bastille and burned.</p>

<p>Then a frantic joy burst forth, as if, instead of the
throne, a future of boundless happiness had appeared;
and the people, less through a spirit of vindictiveness
than to assert their right of possession, broke or tore
the glasses, the curtains, the lustres, the tapers, the
tables, the chairs, the stools, the entire furniture, including
the very albums and engravings, and the corbels
of the tapestry. Since they had triumphed, they
must needs amuse themselves! The common herd
ironically wrapped themselves up in laces and cashmeres.
Gold fringes were rolled round the sleeves of
blouses. Hats with ostriches' feathers adorned blacksmiths'
heads, and ribbons of the Legion of Honour
supplied waistbands for prostitutes. Each person
satisfied his or her caprice; some danced, others
drank. In the queen's apartment a woman gave a
gloss to her hair with pomatum. Behind a folding-screen
two lovers were playing cards. Hussonnet
pointed out to Frederick an individual who was
smoking a dirty pipe with his elbows resting on a
balcony; and the popular frenzy redoubled with a
continuous crash of broken porcelain and pieces of
crystal, which, as they rebounded, made sounds
resembling those produced by the plates of musical
glasses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Then their fury was overshadowed. A nauseous
curiosity made them rummage all the dressing-rooms,
all the recesses. Returned convicts thrust their arms
into the beds in which princesses had slept, and
rolled themselves on the top of them, to console
themselves for not being able to embrace their owners.
Others, with sinister faces, roamed about silently,
looking for something to steal, but too great a multitude
was there. Through the bays of the doors
could be seen in the suite of apartments only the
dark mass of people between the gilding of the walls
under a cloud of dust. Every breast was panting.
The heat became more and more suffocating; and
the two friends, afraid of being stifled, seized the opportunity
of making their way out.</p>

<p>In the antechamber, standing on a heap of garments,
appeared a girl of the town as a statue of
Liberty, motionless, her grey eyes wide open&mdash;a
fearful sight.</p>

<p>They had taken three steps outside the ch&acirc;teau
when a company of the National Guards, in great-coats,
advanced towards them, and, taking off their
foraging-caps, and, at the same time, uncovering their
skulls, which were slightly bald, bowed very low to
the people. At this testimony of respect, the ragged
victors bridled up. Hussonnet and Frederick were not
without experiencing a certain pleasure from it as
well as the rest.</p>

<p>They were filled with ardour. They went back
to the Palais-Royal. In front of the Rue Fromanteau,
soldiers' corpses were heaped up on the straw. They
passed close to the dead without a single quiver of
emotion, feeling a certain pride in being able to keep
their countenance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The Palais overflowed with people. In the inner
courtyard seven piles of wood were flaming. Pianos,
chests of drawers, and clocks were hurled out through
the windows. Fire-engines sent streams of water up
to the roofs. Some vagabonds tried to cut the hose
with their sabres. Frederick urged a pupil of the
Polytechnic School to interfere. The latter did not
understand him, and, moreover, appeared to be an
idiot. All around, in the two galleries, the populace,
having got possession of the cellars, gave themselves
up to a horrible carouse. Wine flowed in streams
and wetted people's feet; the mudlarks drank out of
the tail-ends of the bottles, and shouted as they staggered
along.</p>

<p>"Come away out of this," said Hussonnet; "I am
disgusted with the people."</p>

<p>All over the Orl&eacute;ans Gallery the wounded lay on
mattresses on the ground, with purple curtains folded
round them as coverlets; and the small shopkeepers'
wives and daughters from the quarter brought them
broth and linen.</p>

<p>"No matter!" said Frederick; "for my part, I
consider the people sublime."</p>

<p>The great vestibule was filled with a whirlwind of
furious individuals. Men tried to ascend to the
upper storys in order to put the finishing touches to
the work of wholesale destruction. National Guards,
on the steps, strove to keep them back. The most
intrepid was a chasseur, who had his head bare, his
hair bristling, and his straps in pieces. His shirt
caused a swelling between his trousers and his coat,
and he struggled desperately in the midst of the
others. Hussonnet, who had sharp sight, recognised
Arnoux from a distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they went into the Tuileries garden, so as
to be able to breathe more freely. They sat down
on a bench; and they remained for some minutes
with their eyes closed, so much stunned that they
had not the energy to say a word. The people who
were passing came up to them and informed them
that the Duchesse d'Orl&eacute;ans had been appointed Regent,
and that it was all over. They were experiencing
that species of comfort which follows rapid
<i>d&eacute;nouements</i>, when at the windows of the attics in
the ch&acirc;teau appeared men-servants tearing their liveries
to pieces. They flung their torn clothes into
the garden, as a mark of renunciation. The people
hooted at them, and then they retired.</p>

<p>The attention of Frederick and Hussonnet was distracted
by a tall fellow who was walking quickly between
the trees with a musket on his shoulder. A
cartridge-box was pressed against his pea-jacket; a
handkerchief was wound round his forehead under
his cap. He turned his head to one side. It was
Dussardier; and casting himself into their arms:</p>

<p>"Ah! what good fortune, my poor old friends!"
without being able to say another word, so much
out of breath was he with fatigue.</p>

<p>He had been on his legs for the last twenty-four
hours. He had been engaged at the barricades of the
Latin Quarter, had fought in the Rue Rabuteau, had
saved three dragoons' lives, had entered the Tuileries
with Colonel Dunoyer, and, after that, had repaired
to the Chamber, and then to the H&ocirc;tel de Ville.</p>

<p>"I have come from it! all goes well! the people
are victorious! the workmen and the employers are
embracing one another. Ha! if you knew what I have
seen! what brave fellows! what a fine sight it was!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>And without noticing that they had no arms:</p>

<p>"I was quite certain of finding you there! This
has been a bit rough&mdash;no matter!"</p>

<p>A drop of blood ran down his cheek, and in answer
to the questions put to him by the two others:</p>

<p>"Oh! 'tis nothing! a slight scratch from a bayonet!"</p>

<p>"However, you really ought to take care of yourself."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I am substantial! What does this signify?
The Republic is proclaimed! We'll be happy
henceforth! Some journalists, who were talking just
now in front of me, said they were going to liberate
Poland and Italy! No more kings! You understand?
The entire land free! the entire land free!"</p>

<p>And with one comprehensive glance at the horizon,
he spread out his arms in a triumphant attitude.
But a long file of men rushed over the terrace on the
water's edge.</p>

<p>"Ah, deuce take it! I was forgetting. I must be
off. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>He turned round to cry out to them while brandishing
his musket:</p>

<p>"Long live the Republic!"</p>

<p>From the chimneys of the ch&acirc;teau escaped enormous
whirlwinds of black smoke which bore sparks
along with them. The ringing of the bells sent out
over the city a wild and startling alarm. Right and
left, in every direction, the conquerors discharged
their weapons.</p>

<p>Frederick, though he was not a warrior, felt the
Gallic blood leaping in his veins. The magnetism of
the public enthusiasm had seized hold of him. He
inhaled with a voluptuous delight the stormy atmos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>phere
filled with the odour of gunpowder; and, in the
meantime, he quivered under the effluvium of an immense
love, a supreme and universal tenderness, as if
the heart of all humanity were throbbing in his breast.</p>

<p>Hussonnet said with a yawn:</p>

<p>"It would be time, perhaps, to go and instruct
the populace."</p>

<p>Frederick followed him to his correspondence-office
in the Place de la Bourse; and he began to
compose for the Troyes newspaper an account of recent
events in a lyric style&mdash;a veritable tit-bit&mdash;to
which he attached his signature. Then they dined
together at a tavern. Hussonnet was pensive; the
eccentricities of the Revolution exceeded his own.</p>

<p>After leaving the caf&eacute;, when they repaired to the
H&ocirc;tel de Ville to learn the news, the boyish impulses
which were natural to him had got the upper
hand once more. He scaled the barricades like a
chamois, and answered the sentinels with broad jokes
of a patriotic flavour.</p>

<p>They heard the Provisional Government proclaimed
by torchlight. At last, Frederick got back to his
house at midnight, overcome with fatigue.</p>

<p>"Well," said he to his man-servant, while the
latter was undressing him, "are you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Yes, no doubt, Monsieur; but I don't like to see
the people dancing to music."</p>

<p>Next morning, when he awoke, Frederick thought
of Deslauriers. He hastened to his friend's lodgings.
He ascertained that the advocate had just left Paris,
having been appointed a provincial commissioner. At
the <i>soir&eacute;e</i> given the night before, he had got into
contact with Ledru-Rollin, and laying siege to him in
the name of the Law Schools, had snatched from him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
a post, a mission. However, the doorkeeper explained,
he was going to write and give his address
in the following week.</p>

<p>After this, Frederick went to see the Mar&eacute;chale.
She gave him a chilling reception. She resented his
desertion of her. Her bitterness disappeared when he
had given her repeated assurances that peace was
restored.</p>

<p>All was quiet now. There was no reason to be
afraid. He kissed her, and she declared herself in
favour of the Republic, as his lordship the Archbishop
of Paris had already done, and as the magistracy, the
Council of State, the Institute, the marshals of France,
Changarnier, M. de Falloux, all the Bonapartists, all
the Legitimists, and a considerable number of Orl&eacute;anists
were about to do with a swiftness indicative of
marvellous zeal.</p>

<p>The fall of the Monarchy had been so rapid that,
as soon as the first stupefaction that succeeded it had
passed away, there was amongst the middle class a
feeling of astonishment at the fact that they were
still alive. The summary execution of some thieves,
who were shot without a trial, was regarded as an
act of signal justice. For a month Lamartine's phrase
was repeated with reference to the red flag, "which
had only gone the round of the Champ de Mars,
while the tricoloured flag," etc.; and all ranged themselves
under its shade, each party seeing amongst the
three colours only its own, and firmly determined, as
soon as it would be the most powerful, to tear away
the two others.</p>

<p>As business was suspended, anxiety and love of
gaping drove everyone into the open air. The careless
style of costume generally adopted attenuated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
differences of social position. Hatred masked itself;
expectations were openly indulged in; the multitude
seemed full of good-nature. The pride of having
gained their rights shone in the people's faces. They
displayed the gaiety of a carnival, the manners of a
bivouac. Nothing could be more amusing than the
aspect of Paris during the first days that followed the
Revolution.</p>

<p>Frederick gave the Mar&eacute;chale his arm, and they
strolled along through the streets together. She was
highly diverted by the display of rosettes in every
buttonhole, by the banners hung from every window,
and the bills of every colour that were posted
upon the walls, and threw some money here and
there into the collection-boxes for the wounded,
which were placed on chairs in the middle of the
pathway. Then she stopped before some caricatures
representing Louis Philippe as a pastry-cook, as a
mountebank, as a dog, or as a leech. But she was a
little frightened at the sight of Caussidi&egrave;re's men
with their sabres and scarfs. At other times it was
a tree of Liberty that was being planted. The clergy
vied with each other in blessing the Republic,
escorted by servants in gold lace; and the populace
thought this very fine. The most frequent spectacle
was that of deputations from no matter what,
going to demand something at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville,
for every trade, every industry, was looking to the
Government to put a complete end to its wretchedness.
Some of them, it is true, went to offer it advice
or to congratulate it, or merely to pay it a little
visit, and to see the machine performing its functions.
One day, about the middle of the month of
March, as they were passing the Pont d'Arcole,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
having to do some commission for Rosanette in the
Latin Quarter, Frederick saw approaching a column
of individuals with oddly-shaped hats and long
beards. At its head, beating a drum, walked a negro
who had formerly been an artist's model; and the
man who bore the banner, on which this inscription
floated in the wind, "Artist-Painters," was no other
than Pellerin.</p>

<p>He made a sign to Frederick to wait for him, and
then reappeared five minutes afterwards, having some
time before him; for the Government was, at that moment,
receiving a deputation from the stone-cutters.
He was going with his colleagues to ask for the creation
of a Forum of Art, a kind of Exchange where
the interests of &AElig;sthetics would be discussed. Sublime
masterpieces would be produced, inasmuch as
the workers would amalgamate their talents. Ere
long Paris would be covered with gigantic monuments.
He would decorate them. He had even begun
a figure of the Republic. One of his comrades
had come to take it, for they were closely pursued by
the deputation from the poulterers.</p>

<p>"What stupidity!" growled a voice in the crowd.
"Always some humbug, nothing strong!"</p>

<p>It was Regimbart. He did not salute Frederick,
but took advantage of the occasion to give vent to
his own bitterness.</p>

<p>The Citizen spent his days wandering about the
streets, pulling his moustache, rolling his eyes about,
accepting and propagating any dismal news that was
communicated to him; and he had only two phrases:
"Take care! we're going to be run over!" or else,
"Why, confound it! they're juggling with the Republic!"
He was discontented with everything, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
especially with the fact that we had not taken back
our natural frontiers.</p>

<p>The very name of Lamartine made him shrug his
shoulders. He did not consider Ledru-Rollin "sufficient
for the problem," referred to Dupont (of the
Eure) as an old numbskull, Albert as an idiot, Louis
Blanc as an Utopist, and Blanqui as an exceedingly
dangerous man; and when Frederick asked him what
would be the best thing to do, he replied, pressing
his arm till he nearly bruised it:</p>

<p>"To take the Rhine, I tell you! to take the Rhine,
damn it!"</p>

<p>Then he blamed the Reactionaries. They were
taking off the mask. The sack of the ch&acirc;teau of
Neuilly and Suresne, the fire at Batignolles, the troubles
at Lyons, all the excesses and all the grievances,
were just now being exaggerated by having superadded
to them Ledru-Rollin's circular, the forced currency
of bank-notes, the fall of the funds to sixty
francs, and, to crown all, as the supreme iniquity, a
final blow, a culminating horror, the duty of forty-five
centimes! And over and above all these things,
there was again Socialism! Although these theories,
as new as the game of goose, had been discussed
sufficiently for forty years to fill a number of libraries,
they terrified the wealthier citizens, as if they had
been a hailstorm of a&euml;rolites; and they expressed indignation
at them by virtue of that hatred which the
advent of every idea provokes, simply because it is
an idea&mdash;an odium from which it derives subsequently
its glory, and which causes its enemies to be
always beneath it, however lowly it may be.</p>

<p>Then Property rose in their regard to the level of
Religion, and was confounded with God. The attacks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
made on it appeared to them a sacrilege; almost a species
of cannibalism. In spite of the most humane legislation
that ever existed, the spectre of '93 reappeared,
and the chopper of the guillotine vibrated in every
syllable of the word "Republic," which did not prevent
them from despising it for its weakness. France,
no longer feeling herself mistress of the situation, was
beginning to shriek with terror, like a blind man without
his stick or an infant that had lost its nurse.</p>

<p>Of all Frenchmen, M. Dambreuse was the most
alarmed. The new condition of things threatened his
fortune, but, more than anything else, it deceived his
experience. A system so good! a king so wise! was
it possible? The ground was giving way beneath
their feet! Next morning he dismissed three of his
servants, sold his horses, bought a soft hat to go out
into the streets, thought even of letting his beard
grow; and he remained at home, prostrated, reading
over and over again newspapers most hostile to his
own ideas, and plunged into such a gloomy mood
that even the jokes about the pipe of Flocon<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> had
not the power to make him smile.</p>

<p>As a supporter of the last reign, he was dreading
the vengeance of the people so far as concerned his
estates in Champagne when Frederick's lucubration
fell into his hands. Then it occurred to his mind
that his young friend was a very useful personage,
and that he might be able, if not to serve him, at
least to protect him, so that, one morning, M. Dambreuse
presented himself at Frederick's residence, accompanied
by Martinon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>This visit, he said, had no object save that of seeing
him for a little while, and having a chat with him.
In short, he rejoiced at the events that had happened,
and with his whole heart adopted "our sublime motto,
<i>Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity</i>," having always been
at bottom a Republican. If he voted under the other
<i>r&eacute;gime</i> with the Ministry, it was simply in order to
accelerate an inevitable downfall. He even inveighed
against M. Guizot, "who has got us into a nice
hobble, we must admit!" By way of retaliation, he
spoke in an enthusiastic fashion about Lamartine, who
had shown himself "magnificent, upon my word of
honour, when, with reference to the red flag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Frederick. After which he
declared that his sympathies were on the side of the
working-men.</p>

<p>"For, in fact, more or less, we are all working-men!"
And he carried his impartiality so far as to
acknowledge that Proudhon had a certain amount of
logic in his views. "Oh, a great deal of logic, deuce
take it!"</p>

<p>Then, with the disinterestedness of a superior
mind, he chatted about the exhibition of pictures, at
which he had seen Pellerin's work. He considered it
original and well-painted.</p>

<p>Martinon backed up all he said with expressions
of approval; and likewise was of his opinion that it
was necessary to rally boldly to the side of the Republic.
And he talked about the husbandman, his
father, and assumed the part of the peasant, the man
of the people. They soon came to the question of
the elections for the National Assembly, and the candidates
in the arrondissement of La Fortelle. The Opposition
candidate had no chance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should take his place!" said M. Dambreuse.</p>

<p>Frederick protested.</p>

<p>"But why not?" For he would obtain the suffrages
of the Extremists owing to his personal opinions,
and that of the Conservatives on account of his
family; "And perhaps also," added the banker, with
a smile, "thanks to my influence, in some measure."</p>

<p>Frederick urged as an obstacle that he did not
know how to set about it.</p>

<p>There was nothing easier if he only got himself
recommended to the patriots of the Aube by one of
the clubs of the capital. All he had to do was to
read out, not a profession of faith such as might be
seen every day, but a serious statement of principles.</p>

<p>"Bring it to me; I know what goes down in the
locality; and you can, I say again, render great services
to the country&mdash;to us all&mdash;to myself."</p>

<p>In such times people ought to aid each other,
and, if Frederick had need of anything, he or his
friends&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, a thousand thanks, my dear Monsieur!"</p>

<p>"You'll do as much for me in return, mind!"</p>

<p>Decidedly, the banker was a decent man.</p>

<p>Frederick could not refrain from pondering over
his advice; and soon he was dazzled by a kind of
dizziness.</p>

<p>The great figures of the Convention passed before
his mental vision. It seemed to him that a splendid
dawn was about to rise. Rome, Vienna and Berlin
were in a state of insurrection, and the Austrians had
been driven out of Venice. All Europe was agitated.
Now was the time to make a plunge into the movement,
and perhaps to accelerate it; and then he was
fascinated by the costume which it was said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
deputies would wear. Already he saw himself in a
waistcoat with lapels and a tricoloured sash; and this
itching, this hallucination, became so violent that he
opened his mind to Dambreuse.</p>

<p>The honest fellow's enthusiasm had not abated.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;sure enough! Offer yourself!"</p>

<p>Frederick, nevertheless, consulted Deslauriers.</p>

<p>The idiotic opposition which trammelled the commissioner
in his province had augmented his Liberalism.
He at once replied, exhorting Frederick with
the utmost vehemence to come forward as a candidate.
However, as the latter was desirous of having
the approval of a great number of persons, he confided
the thing to Rosanette one day, when Mademoiselle
Vatnaz happened to be present.</p>

<p>She was one of those Parisian spinsters who, every
evening when they have given their lessons or tried
to sell little sketches, or to dispose of poor manuscripts,
return to their own homes with mud on their
petticoats, make their own dinner, which they eat by
themselves, and then, with their soles resting on a
foot-warmer, by the light of a filthy lamp, dream of
a love, a family, a hearth, wealth&mdash;all that they lack.
So it was that, like many others, she had hailed in
the Revolution the advent of vengeance, and she delivered
herself up to a Socialistic propaganda of the
most unbridled description.</p>

<p>The enfranchisement of the proletariat, according
to the Vatnaz, was only possible by the enfranchisement
of woman. She wished to have her own sex
admitted to every kind of employment, to have an
enquiry made into the paternity of children, a different
code, the abolition, or at least a more intelligent
regulation, of marriage. In that case every French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>woman
would be bound to marry a Frenchman, or
to adopt an old man. Nurses and midwives should
be officials receiving salaries from the State.</p>

<p>There should be a jury to examine the works of
women, special editors for women, a polytechnic
school for women, a National Guard for women,
everything for women! And, since the Government
ignored their rights, they ought to overcome force by
force. Ten thousand citizenesses with good guns
ought to make the H&ocirc;tel de Ville quake!</p>

<p>Frederick's candidature appeared to her favourable
for carrying out her ideas. She encouraged him,
pointing out the glory that shone on the horizon.
Rosanette was delighted at the notion of having a
man who would make speeches at the Chamber.</p>

<p>"And then, perhaps, they'll give you a good
place?"</p>

<p>Frederick, a man prone to every kind of weakness,
was infected by the universal mania. He wrote an
address and went to show it to M. Dambreuse.</p>

<p>At the sound made by the great door falling back,
a curtain gaped open a little behind a casement, and
a woman appeared at it He had not time to find
out who she was; but, in the anteroom, a picture arrested
his attention&mdash;Pellerin's picture&mdash;which lay
on a chair, no doubt provisionally.</p>

<p>It represented the Republic, or Progress, or Civilisation,
under the form of Jesus Christ driving a locomotive,
which was passing through a virgin forest.
Frederick, after a minute's contemplation, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a vile thing!"</p>

<p>"Is it not&mdash;eh?" said M. Dambreuse, coming in
unexpectedly just at the moment when the other was
giving utterance to this opinion, and fancying that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
had reference, not so much to the picture as to the
doctrine glorified by the work. Martinon presented
himself at the same time. They made their way into
the study, and Frederick was drawing a paper out of
his pocket, when Mademoiselle C&eacute;cile, entering suddenly,
said, articulating her words in an ingenuous
fashion:</p>

<p>"Is my aunt here?"</p>

<p>"You know well she is not," replied the banker.
"No matter! act as if you were at home, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Oh! thanks! I am going away!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had she left when Martinon seemed to be
searching for his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I forgot to take it out of my great-coat&mdash;excuse
me!"</p>

<p>"All right!" said M. Dambreuse.</p>

<p>Evidently he was not deceived by this man&oelig;uvre,
and even seemed to regard it with favour. Why?
But Martinon soon reappeared, and Frederick began
reading his address.</p>

<p>At the second page, which pointed towards the
preponderance of the financial interests as a disgraceful
fact, the banker made a grimace. Then, touching
on reforms, Frederick demanded free trade.</p>

<p>"What? Allow me, now!"</p>

<p>The other paid no attention, and went on. He
called for a tax on yearly incomes, a progressive tax,
a European federation, and the education of the
people, the encouragement of the fine arts on the liberal
scale.</p>

<p>"When the country could provide men like Delacroix
or Hugo with incomes of a hundred thousand
francs, where would be the harm?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of the address advice was given to
the upper classes.</p>

<p>"Spare nothing, ye rich; but give! give!"</p>

<p>He stopped, and remained standing. The two
who had been listening to him did not utter a word.
Martinon opened his eyes wide; M. Dambreuse was
quite pale. At last, concealing his emotion under a
bitter smile:</p>

<p>"That address of yours is simply perfect!" And
he praised the style exceedingly in order to avoid
giving his opinion as to the matter of the address.</p>

<p>This virulence on the part of an inoffensive young
man frightened him, especially as a sign of the times.</p>

<p>Martinon tried to reassure him. The Conservative
party, in a little while, would certainly be able to
take its revenge. In several cities the commissioners
of the provisional government had been driven away;
the elections were not to occur till the twenty-third
of April; there was plenty of time. In short, it was
necessary for M. Dambreuse to present himself personally
in the Aube; and from that time forth, Martinon
no longer left his side, became his secretary,
and was as attentive to him as any son could be.</p>

<p>Frederick arrived at Rosanette's house in a very
self-complacent mood. Delmar happened to be there,
and told him of his intention to stand as a candidate
at the Seine elections. In a placard addressed to the
people, in which he addressed them in the familiar
manner which one adopts towards an individual, the
actor boasted of being able to understand them, and
of having, in order to save them, got himself "crucified
for the sake of art," so that he was the incarnation,
the ideal of the popular spirit, believing that
he had, in fact, such enormous power over the masses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that he proposed by-and-by, when he occupied a
ministerial office, to quell any outbreak by himself
alone; and, with regard to the means he would employ,
he gave this answer: "Never fear! I'll show
them my head!"</p>

<p>Frederick, in order to mortify him, gave him to
understand that he was himself a candidate. The
mummer, from the moment that his future colleague
aspired to represent the province, declared himself his
servant, and offered to be his guide to the various
clubs.</p>

<p>They visited them, or nearly all, the red and the
blue, the furious and the tranquil, the puritanical and
the licentious, the mystical and the intemperate, those
that had voted for the death of kings, and those in
which the frauds in the grocery trade had been denounced;
and everywhere the tenants cursed the
landlords; the blouse was full of spite against broadcloth;
and the rich conspired against the poor. Many
wanted indemnities on the ground that they had formerly
been martyrs of the police; others appealed for
money in order to carry out certain inventions, or
else there were plans of phalansteria, projects for
cantonal bazaars, systems of public felicity; then,
here and there a flash of genius amid these clouds of
folly, sudden as splashes, the law formulated by an
oath, and flowers of eloquence on the lips of some
soldier-boy, with a shoulder-belt strapped over his
bare, shirtless chest. Sometimes, too, a gentleman
made his appearance&mdash;an aristocrat of humble demeanour,
talking in a plebeian strain, and with his
hands unwashed, so as to make them look hard. A
patriot recognised him; the most virtuous mobbed
him; and he went off with rage in his soul. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
pretext of good sense, it was desirable to be always
disparaging the advocates, and to make use as often
as possible of these expressions: "To carry his stone
to the building," "social problem," "workshop."</p>

<p>Delmar did not miss the opportunities afforded
him for getting in a word; and when he no longer
found anything to say, his device was to plant himself
in some conspicuous position with one of his
arms akimbo and the other in his waistcoat, turning
himself round abruptly in profile, so as to give a
good view of his head. Then there were outbursts
of applause, which came from Mademoiselle Vatnaz
at the lower end of the hall.</p>

<p>Frederick, in spite of the weakness of orators, did
not dare to try the experiment of speaking. All those
people seemed to him too unpolished or too hostile.</p>

<p>But Dussardier made enquiries, and informed him
that there existed in the Rue Saint-Jacques a club
which bore the name of the "Club of Intellect."
Such a name gave good reason for hope. Besides,
he would bring some friends there.</p>

<p>He brought those whom he had invited to take
punch with him&mdash;the bookkeeper, the traveller in
wines, and the architect; even Pellerin had offered to
come, and Hussonnet would probably form one of
the party, and on the footpath before the door stood
Regimbart, with two individuals, the first of whom
was his faithful Compain, a rather thick-set man
marked with small-pox and with bloodshot eyes; and
the second, an ape-like negro, exceedingly hairy, and
whom he knew only in the character of "a patriot
from Barcelona."</p>

<p>They passed though a passage, and were then introduced
into a large room, no doubt used by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
joiner, and with walls still fresh and smelling of plaster.
Four argand lamps were hanging parallel to
each other, and shed an unpleasant light. On a platform,
at the end of the room, there was a desk with
a bell; underneath it a table, representing the rostrum,
and on each side two others, somewhat lower,
for the secretaries. The audience that adorned the
benches consisted of old painters of daubs, ushers,
and literary men who could not get their works
published.</p>

<p>In the midst of those lines of paletots with greasy
collars could be seen here and there a woman's cap
or a workman's linen smock. The bottom of the
apartment was even full of workmen, who had in all
likelihood come there to pass away an idle hour, and
who had been introduced by some speakers in order
that they might applaud.</p>

<p>Frederick took care to place himself between Dussardier
and Regimbart, who was scarcely seated when
he leaned both hands on his walking-stick and his chin
on his hands and shut his eyes, whilst at the other
end of the room Delmar stood looking down at the
assembly. S&eacute;n&eacute;cal appeared at the president's desk.</p>

<p>The worthy bookkeeper thought Frederick would
be pleased at this unexpected discovery. It only annoyed
him.</p>

<p>The meeting exhibited great respect for the president.
He was one who, on the twenty-fifth of February,
had desired an immediate organisation of labour.
On the following day, at the Prado, he had declared
himself in favour attacking the H&ocirc;tel de Ville; and,
as every person at that period took some model for
imitation, one copied Saint-Just, another Danton, another
Marat; as for him, he tried to be like Blanqui,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
who imitated Robespierre. His black gloves, and his
hair brushed back, gave him a rigid aspect exceedingly
becoming.</p>

<p>He opened the proceedings with the declaration of
the Rights of Man and of the Citizen&mdash;a customary
act of faith. Then, a vigorous voice struck up B&eacute;ranger's
"Souvenirs du Peuple."</p>

<p>Other voices were raised:</p>

<p>"No! no! not that!"</p>

<p>"'La Casquette!'" the patriots at the bottom of
the apartment began to howl.</p>

<p>And they sang in chorus the favourite lines of the
period:</p>

<p>
"Doff your hat before my cap&mdash;<br />
Kneel before the working-man!"<br />
</p>

<p>At a word from the president the audience became
silent.</p>

<p>One of the secretaries proceeded to inspect the
letters.</p>

<p>Some young men announced that they burned a
number of the <i>Assembl&eacute;e Nationale</i> every evening in
front of the Panth&eacute;on, and they urged on all patriots
to follow their example.</p>

<p>"Bravo! adopted!" responded the audience.</p>

<p>The Citizen Jean Jacques Langreneux, a printer in
the Rue Dauphin, would like to have a monument
raised to the memory of the martyrs of Thermidor.</p>

<p>Michel Evariste N&eacute;pomuc&egrave;ne, ex-professor, gave
expression to the wish that the European democracy
should adopt unity of language. A dead language
might be used for that purpose&mdash;as, for example,
improved Latin.</p>

<p>"No; no Latin!" exclaimed the architect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" said the college-usher.</p>

<p>And these two gentlemen engaged in a discussion,
in which the others also took part, each putting in a
word of his own for effect; and the conversation on
this topic soon became so tedious that many went
away. But a little old man, who wore at the top of
his prodigiously high forehead a pair of green spectacles,
asked permission to speak in order to make
an important communication.</p>

<p>It was a memorandum on the assessment of taxes.
The figures flowed on in a continuous stream, as if
they were never going to end. The impatience of
the audience found vent at first in murmurs, in whispered
talk. He allowed nothing to put him out.
Then they began hissing; they catcalled him. S&eacute;n&eacute;cal
called the persons who were interrupting to order.
The orator went on like a machine. It was necessary
to catch him by the shoulder in order to stop him.
The old fellow looked as if he were waking out of a
dream, and, placidly lifting his spectacles, said:</p>

<p>"Pardon me, citizens! pardon me! I am going&mdash;a
thousand excuses!"</p>

<p>Frederick was disconcerted with the failure of the
old man's attempts to read this written statement.
He had his own address in his pocket, but an extemporaneous
speech would have been preferable.</p>

<p>Finally the president announced that they were
about to pass on to the important matter, the electoral
question. They would not discuss the big Republican
lists. However, the "Club of Intellect" had
every right, like every other, to form one, "with all
respect for the pachas of the H&ocirc;tel de Ville," and the
citizens who solicited the popular mandate might set
forth their claims.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go on, now!" said Dussardier.</p>

<p>A man in a cassock, with woolly hair and a petulant
expression on his face, had already raised his
hand. He said, with a stutter, that his name was
Ducretot, priest and agriculturist, and that he was the
author of a work entitled "Manures." He was told
to send it to a horticultural club.</p>

<p>Then a patriot in a blouse climbed up into the
rostrum. He was a plebeian, with broad shoulders,
a big face, very mild-looking, with long black hair.
He cast on the assembly an almost voluptuous glance,
flung back his head, and, finally, spreading out his
arms:</p>

<p>"You have repelled Ducretot, O my brothers! and
you have done right; but it was not through irreligion,
for we are all religious."</p>

<p>Many of those present listened open-mouthed,
with the air of catechumens and in ecstatic attitudes.</p>

<p>"It is not either because he is a priest, for we,
too, are priests! The workman is a priest, just as
the founder of Socialism was&mdash;the Master of us all,
Jesus Christ!"</p>

<p>The time had arrived to inaugurate the Kingdom
of God. The Gospel led directly to '89. After the
abolition of slavery, the abolition of the proletariat.
They had had the age of hate&mdash;the age of love was
about to begin.</p>

<p>"Christianity is the keystone and the foundation
of the new edifice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are making game of us?" exclaimed the
traveller in wines. "Who has given me such a
priest's cap?"</p>

<p>This interruption gave great offence. Nearly all
the audience got on benches, and, shaking their fists,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
shouted: "Atheist! aristocrat! low rascal!" whilst
the president's bell kept ringing continuously, and the
cries of "Order! order!" redoubled. But, aimless,
and, moreover, fortified by three cups of coffee which
he had swallowed before coming to the meeting, he
struggled in the midst of the others:</p>

<p>"What? I an aristocrat? Come, now!"</p>

<p>When, at length, he was permitted to give an explanation,
he declared that he would never be at peace
with the priests; and, since something had just been
said about economical measures, it would be a splendid
one to put an end to the churches, the sacred
pyxes, and finally all creeds.</p>

<p>Somebody raised the objection that he was going
very far.</p>

<p>"Yes! I am going very far! But, when a vessel
is caught suddenly in a storm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Without waiting for the conclusion of this simile,
another made a reply to his observation:</p>

<p>"Granted! But this is to demolish at a single
stroke, like a mason devoid of judgment&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are insulting the masons!" yelled a citizen
covered with plaster. And persisting in the belief
that provocation had been offered to him, he vomited
forth insults, and wished to fight, clinging tightly to
the bench whereon he sat. It took no less than three
men to put him out.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the workman still remained on the
rostrum. The two secretaries gave him an intimation
that he should come down. He protested against the
injustice done to him.</p>

<p>"You shall not prevent me from crying out,
'Eternal love to our dear France! eternal love all to
the Republic!'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Citizens!" said Compain, after this&mdash;"Citizens!"</p>

<p>And, by dint of repeating "Citizens," having obtained
a little silence, he leaned on the rostrum with
his two red hands, which looked like stumps, bent
forward his body, and blinking his eyes:</p>

<p>"I believe that it would be necessary to give a
larger extension to the calf's head."</p>

<p>All who heard him kept silent, fancying that they
had misunderstood his words.</p>

<p>"Yes! the calf's head!"</p>

<p>Three hundred laughs burst forth at the same time.
The ceiling shook.</p>

<p>At the sight of all these faces convulsed with mirth,
Compain shrank back. He continued in an angry tone:</p>

<p>"What! you don't know what the calf's head is!"</p>

<p>It was a paroxysm, a delirium. They held their
sides. Some of them even tumbled off the benches
to the ground with convulsions of laughter. Compain,
not being able to stand it any longer, took refuge
beside Regimbart, and wanted to drag him away.</p>

<p>"No! I am remaining till 'tis all over!" said the
Citizen.</p>

<p>This reply caused Frederick to make up his mind;
and, as he looked about to the right and the left to
see whether his friends were prepared to support
him, he saw Pellerin on the rostrum in front of him.</p>

<p>The artist assumed a haughty tone in addressing
the meeting.</p>

<p>"I would like to get some notion as to who is the
candidate amongst all these that represents art. For
my part, I have painted a picture."</p>

<p>"We have nothing to do with painting pictures!"
was the churlish remark of a thin man with red spots
on his cheek-bones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Pellerin protested against this interruption.</p>

<p>But the other, in a tragic tone:</p>

<p>"Ought not the Government to make an ordinance
abolishing prostitution and want?"</p>

<p>And this phrase having at once won to his side
the popular favour, he thundered against the corruption
of great cities.</p>

<p>"Shame and infamy! We ought to catch hold of
wealthy citizens on their way out of the Maison d'Or
and spit in their faces&mdash;unless it be that the Government
countenances debauchery! But the collectors of
the city dues exhibit towards our daughters and our
sisters an amount of indecency&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A voice exclaimed, some distance away:</p>

<p>"This is blackguard language! Turn him out!"</p>

<p>"They extract taxes from us to pay for licentiousness!
Thus, the high salaries paid to actors&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Help!" cried Pellerin.</p>

<p>He leaped from the rostrum, pushed everybody
aside, and declaring that he regarded such stupid accusations
with disgust, expatiated on the civilising
mission of the player. Inasmuch as the theatre was
the focus of national education, he would record his
vote for the reform of the theatre; and to begin with,
no more managements, no more privileges!</p>

<p>"Yes; of any sort!"</p>

<p>The actor's performance excited the audience, and
people moved backwards and forwards knocking each
other down.</p>

<p>"No more academies! No more institutes!"</p>

<p>"No missions!"</p>

<p>"No more bachelorships! Down with University
degrees!"</p>

<p>"Let us preserve them," said S&eacute;n&eacute;cal; "but let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
them be conferred by universal suffrage, by the people,
the only true judge!"</p>

<p>Besides, these things were not the most useful. It
was necessary to take a level which would be above
the heads of the wealthy. And he represented them
as gorging themselves with crimes under their gilded
ceilings; while the poor, writhing in their garrets with
famine, cultivated every virtue. The applause became
so vehement that he interrupted his discourse. For
several minutes he remained with his eyes closed, his
head thrown back, and, as it were, lulling himself to
sleep over the fury which he had aroused.</p>

<p>Then he began to talk in a dogmatic fashion, in
phrases as imperious as laws. The State should take
possession of the banks and of the insurance offices.
Inheritances should be abolished. A social fund
should be established for the workers. Many other
measures were desirable in the future. For the time
being, these would suffice, and, returning to the
question of the elections: "We want pure citizens,
men entirely fresh. Let some one offer himself."</p>

<p>Frederick arose. There was a buzz of approval
made by his friends. But S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, assuming the attitude
of a Fouquier-Tinville, began to ask questions as
to his Christian name and surname, his antecedents,
life, and morals.</p>

<p>Frederick answered succinctly, and bit his lips.
S&eacute;n&eacute;cal asked whether anyone saw any impediment
to this candidature.</p>

<p>"No! no!"</p>

<p>But, for his part, he saw some. All around him
bent forward and strained their ears to listen. The
citizen who was seeking for their support had not
delivered a certain sum promised by him for the foun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>dation
of a democratic journal. Moreover, on the
twenty-second of February, though he had had sufficient
notice on the subject, he had failed to be at the
meeting-place in the Place de Panth&eacute;on.</p>

<p>"I swear that he was at the Tuileries!" exclaimed
Dussardier.</p>

<p>"Can you swear to having seen him at the Panth&eacute;on?"</p>

<p>Dussardier hung down his head. Frederick was
silent. His friends, scandalised, regarded him with
disquietude.</p>

<p>"In any case," S&eacute;n&eacute;cal went on, "do you know
a patriot who will answer to us for your principles?"</p>

<p>"I will!" said Dussardier.</p>

<p>"Oh! this is not enough; another!"</p>

<p>Frederick turned round to Pellerin. The artist replied
to him with a great number of gestures, which
meant:</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear boy, they have rejected myself!
The deuce! What would you have?"</p>

<p>Thereupon Frederick gave Regimbart a nudge.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true; 'tis time! I'm going."</p>

<p>And Regimbart stepped upon the platform; then,
pointing towards the Spaniard, who had followed him:</p>

<p>"Allow me, citizens, to present to you a patriot
from Barcelona!"</p>

<p>The patriot made a low bow, rolled his gleaming
eyes about, and with his hand on his heart:</p>

<p>"Ciudadanos! mucho aprecio el honor that you
have bestowed on me! however great may be vuestra
bondad, mayor vuestra atenci&oacute;n!"</p>

<p>"I claim the right to speak!" cried Frederick.</p>

<p>"Desde que se proclamo la constituti&oacute;n de Cadiz,
ese pacto fundamental of las libertades Espa&ntilde;olas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hasta la ultima revoluci&oacute;n, nuestra patria cuenta numerosos
y heroicos m&aacute;rtires."</p>

<p>Frederick once more made an effort to obtain a
hearing:</p>

<p>"But, citizens!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>The Spaniard went on: "El martes proximo
tendra lugar en la iglesia de la Magdelena un servicio
f&uacute;nebre."</p>

<p>"In fact, this is ridiculous! Nobody understands
him!"</p>

<p>This observation exasperated the audience.</p>

<p>"Turn him out! Turn him out!"</p>

<p>"Who? I?" asked Frederick.</p>

<p>"Yourself!" said S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, majestically. "Out with
you!"</p>

<p>He rose to leave, and the voice of the Iberian pursued
him:</p>

<p>"Y todos los Espa&ntilde;oles descarien ver alli reunidas
las disputaci&oacute;nes de los clubs y de la milicia nacional.
An oraci&oacute;n f&uacute;nebre en honour of the libertad Espa&ntilde;ola
y del mundo entero will be prononciado por un
miembro del clero of Paris en la sala Bonne Nouvelle.
Honour al pueblo frances que llamaria yo el primero
pueblo del mundo, sino fuese ciudadano de otra
naci&oacute;n!"</p>

<p>"Aristo!" screamed one blackguard, shaking his
fist at Frederick, as the latter, boiling with indignation,
rushed out into the yard adjoining the place where
the meeting was held.</p>

<p>He reproached himself for his devotedness, without
reflecting that, after all, the accusations brought against
him were just.</p>

<p>What fatal idea was this candidature! But what
asses! what idiots! He drew comparisons between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
himself and these men, and soothed his wounded
pride with the thought of their stupidity.</p>

<p>Then he felt the need of seeing Rosanette. After
such an exhibition of ugly traits, and so much magniloquence,
her dainty person would be a source of
relaxation. She was aware that he had intended to
present himself at a club that evening. However, she
did not even ask him a single question when he came in.
She was sitting near the fire, ripping open the lining
of a dress. He was surprised to find her thus occupied.</p>

<p>"Hallo! what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself," said she, dryly. "I
am mending my clothes! So much for this Republic
of yours!"</p>

<p>"Why do you call it mine?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you want to make out that it's mine!"</p>

<p>And she began to upbraid him for everything that
had happened in France for the last two months, accusing
him of having brought about the Revolution
and with having ruined her prospects by making
everybody that had money leave Paris, and that she
would by-and-by be dying in a hospital.</p>

<p>"It is easy for you to talk lightly about it, with
your yearly income! However, at the rate at which
things are going on, you won't have your yearly income
long."</p>

<p>"That may be," said Frederick. "The most devoted
are always misunderstood, and if one were not
sustained by one's conscience, the brutes that you
mix yourself up with would make you feel disgusted
with your own self-denial!"</p>

<p>Rosanette gazed at him with knitted brows.</p>

<p>"Eh? What? What self-denial? Monsieur has
not succeeded, it would seem? So much the better!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
It will teach you to make patriotic donations. Oh,
don't lie! I know you have given them three hundred
francs, for this Republic of yours has to be kept.
Well, amuse yourself with it, my good man!"</p>

<p>Under this avalanche of abuse, Frederick passed
from his former disappointment to a more painful disillusion.</p>

<p>He withdrew to the lower end of the apartment.
She came up to him.</p>

<p>"Look here! Think it out a bit! In a country as
in a house, there must be a master, otherwise, everyone
pockets something out of the money spent. At
first, everybody knows that Ledru-Rollin is head over
ears in debt. As for Lamartine, how can you expect
a poet to understand politics? Ah! 'tis all very well
for you to shake your head and to presume that you
have more brains than others; all the same, what I say
is true! But you are always cavilling; a person can't
get in a word with you! For instance, there's Fournier-Fontaine,
who had stores at Saint-Roch! do you
know how much he failed for? Eight hundred thousand
francs! And Gomer, the packer opposite to him&mdash;another
Republican, that one&mdash;he smashed the
tongs on his wife's head, and he drank so much absinthe
that he is going to be put into a private asylum.
That's the way with the whole of them&mdash;the Republicans!
A Republic at twenty-five percent. Ah! yes!
plume yourself upon it!"</p>

<p>Frederick took himself off. He was disgusted at
the foolishness of this girl, which revealed itself all at
once in the language of the populace. He felt himself
even becoming a little patriotic once more.</p>

<p>The ill-temper of Rosanette only increased. Mademoiselle
Vatnaz irritated him with her enthusiasm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Believing that she had a mission, she felt a furious
desire to make speeches, to carry on disputes, and&mdash;sharper
than Rosanette in matters of this sort&mdash;overwhelmed
her with arguments.</p>

<p>One day she made her appearance burning with indignation
against Hussonnet, who had just indulged
in some blackguard remarks at the Woman's Club.
Rosanette approved of this conduct, declaring even
that she would take men's clothes to go and "give
them a bit of her mind, the entire lot of them, and
to whip them."</p>

<p>Frederick entered at the same moment.</p>

<p>"You'll accompany me&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>And, in spite of his presence, a bickering match
took place between them, one of them playing the
part of a citizen's wife and the other of a female
philosopher.</p>

<p>According to Rosanette, women were born exclusively
for love, or in order to bring up children, to be
housekeepers.</p>

<p>According to Mademoiselle Vatnaz, women ought
to have a position in the Government. In former
times, the Gaulish women, and also the Anglo-Saxon
women, took part in the legislation; the squaws of the
Hurons formed a portion of the Council. The work of
civilisation was common to both. It was necessary
that all should contribute towards it, and that fraternity
should be substituted for egoism, association for individualism,
and cultivation on a large scale for minute
subdivision of land.</p>

<p>"Come, that is good! you know a great deal about
culture just now!"</p>

<p>"Why not? Besides, it is a question of humanity,
of its future!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mind your own business!"</p>

<p>"This is my business!"</p>

<p>They got into a passion. Frederick interposed.
The Vatnaz became very heated, and went so far as
to uphold Communism.</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said Rosanette. "How could
such a thing ever come to pass?"</p>

<p>The other brought forward in support of her theory
the examples of the Essenes, the Moravian Brethren,
the Jesuits of Paraguay, the family of the Pingons
near Thiers in Auvergne; and, as she gesticulated a
great deal, her gold chain got entangled in her bundle
of trinkets, to which was attached a gold ornament
in the form of a sheep.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Rosanette turned exceedingly pale.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Vatnaz continued extricating her
trinkets.</p>

<p>"Don't give yourself so much trouble," said Rosanette.
"Now, I know your political opinions."</p>

<p>"What?" replied the Vatnaz, with a blush on her
face like that of a virgin.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! you understand me."</p>

<p>Frederick did not understand. There had evidently
been something taking place between them of a
more important and intimate character than Socialism.</p>

<p>"And even though it should be so," said the Vatnaz
in reply, rising up unflinchingly. "'Tis a loan,
my dear&mdash;set off one debt against the other."</p>

<p>"Faith, I don't deny my own debts. I owe some
thousands of francs&mdash;a nice sum. I borrow, at least;
I don't rob anyone."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Vatnaz made an effort to laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh! I would put my hand in the fire for him."</p>

<p>"Take care! it is dry enough to burn."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The spinster held out her right hand to her, and
keeping it raised in front of her:</p>

<p>"But there are friends of yours who find it convenient
for them."</p>

<p>"Andalusians, I suppose? as castanets?"</p>

<p>"You beggar!"</p>

<p>The Mar&eacute;chale made her a low bow.</p>

<p>"There's nobody so charming!"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Vatnaz made no reply. Beads of
perspiration appeared on her temples. Her eyes fixed
themselves on the carpet. She panted for breath.
At last she reached the door, and slamming it vigorously:
"Good night! You'll hear from me!"</p>

<p>"Much I care!" said Rosanette. The effort of self-suppression
had shattered her nerves. She sank down
on the divan, shaking all over, stammering forth
words of abuse, shedding tears. Was it this threat
on the part of the Vatnaz that had caused so much
agitation in her mind? Oh, no! what did she care,
indeed, about that one? It was the golden sheep, a
present, and in the midst of her tears the name of
Delmar escaped her lips. So, then, she was in love
with the mummer?</p>

<p>"In that case, why did she take on with me?"
Frederick asked himself. "How is it that he has
come back again? Who compels her to keep me?
Where is the sense of this sort of thing?"</p>

<p>Rosanette was still sobbing. She remained all the
time stretched at the edge of the divan, with her
right cheek resting on her two hands, and she seemed
a being so dainty, so free from self-consciousness, and
so sorely troubled, that he drew closer to her and
softly kissed her on the forehead.</p>

<p>Thereupon she gave him assurances of her affec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>tion
for him; the Prince had just left her, they would
be free. But she was for the time being short of
money. "You saw yourself that this was so, the
other day, when I was trying to turn my old linings
to use." No more equipages now! And this was
not all; the upholsterer was threatening to resume
possession of the bedroom and the large drawing-room
furniture. She did not know what to do.</p>

<p>Frederick had a mind to answer:</p>

<p>"Don't annoy yourself about it. I will pay."</p>

<p>But the lady knew how to lie. Experience had
enlightened her. He confined himself to mere expressions
of sympathy.</p>

<p>Rosanette's fears were not vain. It was necessary
to give up the furniture and to quit the handsome
apartment in the Rue Drouot. She took another on
the Boulevard Poissonni&egrave;re, on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>The curiosities of her old boudoir were quite sufficient
to give to the three rooms a coquettish air.
There were Chinese blinds, a tent on the terrace, and
in the drawing-room a second-hand carpet still perfectly
new, with ottomans covered with pink silk.
Frederick had contributed largely to these purchases.
He had felt the joy of a newly-married man who
possesses at last a house of his own, a wife of his
own&mdash;and, being much pleased with the place, he
used to sleep there nearly every evening.</p>

<p>One morning, as he was passing out through the
anteroom, he saw, on the third floor, on the staircase,
the shako of a National Guard who was ascending
it. Where in the world was he going?</p>

<p>Frederick waited. The man continued his progress
up the stairs, with his head slightly bent down. He
raised his eyes. It was my lord Arnoux!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation was clear. They both reddened
simultaneously, overcome by a feeling of embarrassment
common to both.</p>

<p>Arnoux was the first to find a way out of the
difficulty.</p>

<p>"She is better&mdash;isn't that so?" as if Rosanette
were ill, and he had come to learn how she was.</p>

<p>Frederick took advantage of this opening.</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly! at least, so I was told by her
maid," wishing to convey that he had not been allowed
to see her.</p>

<p>Then they stood facing each other, both undecided
as to what they would do next, and eyeing one
another intently. The question now was, which of
the two was going to remain. Arnoux once more
solved the problem.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I'll come back by-and-by. Where are
you going? I go with you!"</p>

<p>And, when they were in the street, he chatted as
naturally as usual. Unquestionably he was not a man
of jealous disposition, or else he was too good-natured
to get angry. Besides, his time was devoted
to serving his country. He never left off his uniform
now. On the twenty-ninth of March he had defended
the offices of the <i>Presse</i>. When the Chamber was
invaded, he distinguished himself by his courage, and
he was at the banquet given to the National Guard
at Amiens.</p>

<p>Hussonnet, who was still on duty with him, availed
himself of his flask and his cigars; but, irreverent by
nature, he delighted in contradicting him, disparaging
the somewhat inaccurate style of the decrees; and decrying
the conferences at the Luxembourg, the women
known as the "V&eacute;suviennes," the political section<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
bearing the name of "Tyroliens"; everything, in fact,
down to the Car of Agriculture, drawn by horses to
the ox-market, and escorted by ill-favoured young
girls. Arnoux, on the other hand, was the upholder
of authority, and dreamed of uniting the different parties.
However, his own affairs had taken an unfavourable
turn, and he was more or less anxious about them.</p>

<p>He was not much troubled about Frederick's relations
with the Mar&eacute;chale; for this discovery made him
feel justified (in his conscience) in withdrawing the
allowance which he had renewed since the Prince had
left her. He pleaded by way of excuse for this step the
embarrassed condition in which he found himself,
uttered many lamentations&mdash;and Rosanette was generous.
The result was that M. Arnoux regarded himself
as the lover who appealed entirely to the heart,
an idea that raised him in his own estimation and
made him feel young again. Having no doubt that
Frederick was paying the Mar&eacute;chale, he fancied that
he was "playing a nice trick" on the young man,
even called at the house in such a stealthy fashion as
to keep the other in ignorance of the fact, and when
they happened to meet, left the coast clear for him.</p>

<p>Frederick was not pleased with this partnership,
and his rival's politeness seemed only an elaborate
piece of sarcasm. But by taking offence at it, he
would have removed from his path every opportunity
of ever finding his way back to Madame Arnoux; and
then, this was the only means whereby he could hear
about her movements. The earthenware-dealer, in accordance
with his usual practice, or perhaps with
some cunning design, recalled her readily in the course
of conversation, and asked him why he no longer
came to see her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick, having exhausted every excuse he could
frame, assured him that he had called several times to
see Madame Arnoux, but without success. Arnoux
was convinced that this was so, for he had often referred
in an eager tone at home to the absence of
their friend, and she had invariably replied that she
was out when he called, so that these two lies, in
place of contradicting, corroborated each other.</p>

<p>The young man's gentle ways and the pleasure of
finding a dupe in him made Arnoux like him all the
better. He carried familiarity to its extreme limits,
not through disdain, but through assurance. One day
he wrote saying that very urgent business compelled
him to be away in the country for twenty-four hours.
He begged of the young man to mount guard in his
stead. Frederick dared not refuse, so he repaired to
the guard-house in the Place du Carrousel.</p>

<p>He had to submit to the society of the National
Guards, and, with the exception of a sugar-refiner,
a witty fellow who drank to an inordinate extent,
they all appeared to him more stupid than their cartridge-boxes.
The principal subject of conversation
amongst them was the substitution of sashes for
belts. Others declaimed against the national workshops.</p>

<p>One man said:</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"</p>

<p>The man to whom the words had been addressed
opened his eyes as if he were standing on the verge
of an abyss.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"</p>

<p>Then, one who was more daring than the rest exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It cannot last! It must come to an end!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>And as the same kind of talk went on till night,
Frederick was bored to death.</p>

<p>Great was his surprise when, at eleven o'clock, he
suddenly beheld Arnoux, who immediately explained
that he had hurried back to set him at liberty, having
disposed of his own business.</p>

<p>The fact was that he had no business to transact.
The whole thing was an invention to enable him to
spend twenty-four hours alone with Rosanette. But the
worthy Arnoux had placed too much confidence in
his own powers, so that, now in the state of lassitude
which was the result, he was seized with remorse.
He had come to thank Frederick, and to
invite him to have some supper.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks! I'm not hungry. All I want
is to go to bed."</p>

<p>"A reason the more for having a snack together.
How flabby you are! One does not go home at
such an hour as this. It is too late! It would be
dangerous!"</p>

<p>Frederick once more yielded. Arnoux was quite a
favorite with his brethren-in-arms, who had not expected
to see him&mdash;and he was a particular crony of
the refiner. They were all fond of him, and he was
such a good fellow that he was sorry Hussonnet was
not there. But he wanted to shut his eyes for one
minute, no longer.</p>

<p>"Sit down beside me!" said he to Frederick, stretching
himself on the camp-bed without taking off his
belt and straps. Through fear of an alarm, in spite of
the regulation, he even kept his gun in his hand,
then stammered out some words:</p>

<p>"My darling! my little angel!" and ere long was
fast asleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who had been talking to each other became
silent; and gradually there was a deep silence in the
guard-house. Frederick tormented by the fleas, kept
staring about him. The wall, painted yellow, had,
half-way up, a long shelf, on which the knapsacks
formed a succession of little humps, while underneath,
the muskets, which had the colour of lead, rose up
side by side; and there could be heard a succession
of snores, produced by the National Guards, whose
stomachs were outlined through the darkness in a confused
fashion. On the top of the stove stood an
empty bottle and some plates. Three straw chairs
were drawn around the table, on which a pack of
cards was displayed. A drum, in the middle of the
bench, let its strap hang down.</p>

<p>A warm breath of air making its way through
the door caused the lamp to smoke. Arnoux slept
with his two arms wide apart; and, as his gun was
placed in a slightly crooked position, with the butt-end
downward, the mouth of the barrel came up
right under his arm. Frederick noticed this, and was
alarmed.</p>

<p>"But, no, I'm wrong, there's nothing to be afraid
of! And yet, suppose he met his death!"</p>

<p>And immediately pictures unrolled themselves before
his mind in endless succession.</p>

<p>He saw himself with her at night in a post-chaise,
then on a river's bank on a summer's evening, and
under the reflection of a lamp at home in their own
house. He even fixed his attention on household expenses
and domestic arrangements, contemplating,
feeling already his happiness between his hands; and
in order to realise it, all that was needed was that
the cock of the gun should rise. The end of it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
could be pushed with one's toe, the gun would go
off&mdash;it would be a mere accident&mdash;nothing more!</p>

<p>Frederick brooded over this idea like a playwright
in the agonies of composition. Suddenly it seemed
to him that it was not far from being carried into
practical operation, and that he was going to contribute
to that result&mdash;that, in fact, he was yearning for
it; and then a feeling of absolute terror took possession
of him. In the midst of this mental distress he
experienced a sense of pleasure, and he allowed himself
to sink deeper and deeper into it, with a dreadful
consciousness all the time that his scruples were
vanishing. In the wildness of his reverie the rest of
the world became effaced, and he could only realise
that he was still alive from the intolerable oppression
on his chest.</p>

<p>"Let us take a drop of white wine!" said the
refiner, as he awoke.</p>

<p>Arnoux sprang to his feet, and, as soon as the
white wine was swallowed, he wanted to relieve
Frederick of his sentry duty.</p>

<p>Then he brought him to have breakfast in the Rue
de Chartres, at Parly's, and as he required to recuperate
his energies, he ordered two dishes of meat, a lobster,
an omelet with rum, a salad, etc., and finished this
off with a brand of Sauterne of 1819 and one of '42
Roman&eacute;e, not to speak of the champagne at dessert
and the liqueurs.</p>

<p>Frederick did not in any way gainsay him. He
was disturbed in mind as if by the thought that the
other might somehow trace on his countenance the
idea that had lately flitted before his imagination.
With both elbows on the table and his head bent
forward, so that he annoyed Frederick by his fixed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
stare, he confided some of his hobbies to the young
man.</p>

<p>He wanted to take for farming purposes all the
embankments on the Northern line, in order to plant
potatoes there, or else to organise on the boulevards
a monster cavalcade in which the celebrities of the
period would figure. He would let all the windows,
which would, at the rate of three francs for each person,
produce a handsome profit. In short, he dreamed
of a great stroke of fortune by means of a monopoly.
He assumed a moral tone, nevertheless, found fault
with excesses and all sorts of misconduct, spoke
about his "poor father," and every evening, as he
said, made an examination of his conscience before
offering his soul to God.</p>

<p>"A little cura&ccedil;ao, eh?"</p>

<p>"Just as you please."</p>

<p>As for the Republic, things would right themselves;
in fact, he looked on himself as the happiest
man on earth; and forgetting himself, he exalted
Rosanette's attractive qualities, and even compared her
with his wife. It was quite a different thing. You
could not imagine a lovelier person!</p>

<p>"Your health!"</p>

<p>Frederick touched glasses with him. He had, out
of complaisance, drunk a little too much. Besides,
the strong sunlight dazzled him; and when they went
up the Rue Vivienne together again, their shoulders
touched each other in a fraternal fashion.</p>

<p>When he got home, Frederick slept till seven
o'clock. After that he called on the Mar&eacute;chale. She
had gone out with somebody&mdash;with Arnoux, perhaps!
Not knowing what to do with himself, he continued
his promenade along the boulevard, but could not get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
past the Porte Saint-Martin, owing to the great crowd
that blocked the way.</p>

<p>Want had abandoned to their own resources a
considerable number of workmen, and they used to
come there every evening, no doubt for the purpose
of holding a review and awaiting a signal.</p>

<p>In spite of the law against riotous assemblies,
these clubs of despair increased to a frightful extent,
and many citizens repaired every day to the spot
through bravado, and because it was the fashion.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Frederick caught a glimpse, three
paces away, of M. Dambreuse along with Martinon.
He turned his head away, for M. Dambreuse having
got himself nominated as a representative of the people,
he cherished a secret spite against him. But the
capitalist stopped him.</p>

<p>"One word, my dear monsieur! I have some explanations
to make to you."</p>

<p>"I am not asking you for any."</p>

<p>"Pray listen to me!"</p>

<p>It was not his fault in any way. Appeals had
been made to him; pressure had, to a certain extent,
been placed on him. Martinon immediately endorsed
all that he had said. Some of the electors of Nogent
had presented themselves in a deputation at his
house.</p>

<p>"Besides, I expected to be free as soon as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A crush of people on the footpath forced M. Dambreuse
to get out of the way. A minute after he reappeared,
saying to Martinon:</p>

<p>"This is a genuine service, really, and you won't
have any reason to regret&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>All three stood with their backs resting against a
shop in order to be able to chat more at their ease.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>From time to time there was a cry of, "Long
live Napol&eacute;on! Long live Barb&egrave;s! Down with Marie!"</p>

<p>The countless throng kept talking in very loud
tones; and all these voices, echoing through the houses,
made, so to speak, the continuous ripple of waves in
a harbour. At intervals they ceased; and then could
be heard voices singing the "Marseillaise."</p>

<p>Under the court-gates, men of mysterious aspect
offered sword-sticks to those who passed. Sometimes
two individuals, one of whom preceded the other,
would wink, and then quickly hurry away. The footpaths
were filled with groups of staring idlers. A
dense crowd swayed to and fro on the pavement.
Entire bands of police-officers, emerging from the
alleys, had scarcely made their way into the midst of
the multitude when they were swallowed up in the
mass of people. Little red flags here and there looked
like flames. Coachmen, from the place where they sat
high up, gesticulated energetically, and then turned to
go back. It was a case of perpetual movement&mdash;one
of the strangest sights that could be conceived.</p>

<p>"How all this," said Martinon, "would have
amused Mademoiselle C&eacute;cile!"</p>

<p>"My wife, as you are aware, does not like my
niece to come with us," returned M. Dambreuse with
a smile.</p>

<p>One could scarcely recognise in him the same man.
For the past three months he had been crying,
"Long live the Republic!" and he had even voted in
favour of the banishment of Orl&eacute;ans. But there should
be an end of concessions. He exhibited his rage so
far as to carry a tomahawk in his pocket.</p>

<p>Martinon had one, too. The magistracy not being
any longer irremovable, he had withdrawn from Par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>quet,
so that he surpassed M. Dambreuse in his display
of violence.</p>

<p>The banker had a special antipathy to Lamartine
(for having supported Ledru-Rollin) and, at the same
time, to Pierre Leroux, Proudhon, Consid&eacute;rant,
Lamennais, and all the cranks, all the Socialists.</p>

<p>"For, in fact, what is it they want? The duty on
meat and arrest for debt have been abolished. Now
the project of a bank for mortgages is under consideration;
the other day it was a national bank; and
here are five millions in the Budget for the working-men!
But luckily, it is over, thanks to Monsieur de
Falloux! Good-bye to them! let them go!"</p>

<p>In fact, not knowing how to maintain the three
hundred thousand men in the national workshops,
the Minister of Public Works had that very day signed
an order inviting all citizens between the ages of
eighteen and twenty to take service as soldiers, or else
to start for the provinces to cultivate the ground there.</p>

<p>They were indignant at the alternative thus put
before them, convinced that the object was to destroy
the Republic. They were aggrieved by the thought
of having to live at a distance from the capital, as if
it were a kind of exile. They saw themselves dying
of fevers in desolate parts of the country. To many
of them, moreover, who had been accustomed to
work of a refined description, agriculture seemed a
degradation; it was, in short, a mockery, a decisive
breach of all the promises which had been made to
them. If they offered any resistance, force would be
employed against them. They had no doubt of it,
and made preparations to anticipate it.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock the riotous assemblies which
had formed at the Bastille and at the Ch&acirc;telet ebbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
back towards the boulevard. From the Porte
Saint-Denis to the Porte Saint-Martin nothing could be
seen save an enormous swarm of people, a single
mass of a dark blue shade, nearly black. The men
of whom one caught a glimpse all had glowing eyes,
pale complexions, faces emaciated with hunger and
excited with a sense of wrong.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some clouds had gathered. The tempestuous
sky roused the electricity that was in the
people, and they kept whirling about of their own accord
with the great swaying movements of a swelling
sea, and one felt that there was an incalculable force
in the depths of this excited throng, and as it were,
the energy of an element. Then they all began exclaiming:
"Lamps! lamps!" Many windows had no
illumination, and stones were flung at the panes. M.
Dambreuse deemed it prudent to withdraw from the
scene. The two young men accompanied him home.
He predicted great disasters. The people might once
more invade the Chamber, and on this point he told
them how he should have been killed on the fifteenth
of May had it not been for the devotion of a National
Guard.</p>

<p>"But I had forgotten! he is a friend of yours&mdash;your
friend the earthenware manufacturer&mdash;Jacques
Arnoux!" The rioters had been actually throttling
him, when that brave citizen caught him in his arms
and put him safely out of their reach.</p>

<p>So it was that, since then, there had been a kind
of intimacy between them.</p>

<p>"It would be necessary, one of these days, to dine
together, and, since you often see him, give him the
assurance that I like him very much. He is an excellent
man, and has, in my opinion, been slandered;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and he has his wits about him in the morning. My
compliments once more! A very good evening!"</p>

<p>Frederick, after he had quitted M. Dambreuse,
went back to the Mar&eacute;chale, and, in a very gloomy
fashion, said that she should choose between him and
Arnoux. She replied that she did not understand
"dumps of this sort," that she did not care about
Arnoux, and had no desire to cling to him. Frederick
was thirsting to fly from Paris. She did not
offer any opposition to this whim; and next morning
they set out for Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>The hotel at which they stayed could be distinguished
from others by a fountain that rippled in the
middle of the courtyard attached to it. The doors of
the various apartments opened out on a corridor, as
in monasteries. The room assigned to them was
large, well-furnished, hung with print, and noiseless,
owing to the scarcity of tourists. Alongside the houses,
people who had nothing to do kept passing up and
down; then, under their windows, when the day was
declining, children in the street would engage in a
game of base; and this tranquillity, following so soon
the tumult they had witnessed in Paris, filled them
with astonishment and exercised over them a soothing
influence.</p>

<p>Every morning at an early hour, they went to
pay a visit to the ch&acirc;teau. As they passed in
through the gate, they had a view of its entire front,
with the five pavilions covered with sharp-pointed
roofs, and its staircase of horseshoe-shape opening
out to the end of the courtyard, which is hemmed
in, to right and left, by two main portions of the
building further down. On the paved ground lichens
blended their colours here and there with the tawny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
hue of bricks, and the entire appearance of the palace,
rust-coloured like old armour, had about it something
of the impassiveness of royalty&mdash;a sort of warlike,
melancholy grandeur.</p>

<p>At last, a man-servant made his appearance with
a bunch of keys in his hand. He first showed them
the apartments of the queens, the Pope's oratory,
the gallery of Francis I., the mahogany table on
which the Emperor signed his abdication, and in one
of the rooms cut in two the old Galerie des Cerfs,
the place where Christine got Monaldeschi assassinated.
Rosanette listened to this narrative attentively,
then, turning towards Frederick:</p>

<p>"No doubt it was through jealousy? Mind yourself!"
After this they passed through the Council
Chamber, the Guards' Room, the Throne Room, and
the drawing-room of Louis XIII. The uncurtained
windows sent forth a white light. The handles of
the window-fastenings and the copper feet of the
pier-tables were slightly tarnished with dust. The
armchairs were everywhere hidden under coarse linen
covers. Above the doors could be seen reliquaries of
Louis XIV., and here and there hangings representing
the gods of Olympus, Psyche, or the battles of
Alexander.</p>

<p>As she was passing in front of the mirrors, Rosanette
stopped for a moment to smooth her head-bands.</p>

<p>After passing through the donjon-court and the
Saint-Saturnin Chapel, they reached the Festal Hall.</p>

<p>They were dazzled by the magnificence of the
ceiling, which was divided into octagonal apartments
set off with gold and silver, more finely chiselled
than a jewel, and by the vast number of paintings
covering the walls, from the immense chimney-piece,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
where the arms of France were surrounded by crescents
and quivers, down to the musicians' gallery,
which had been erected at the other end along the
entire width of the hall. The ten arched windows
were wide open; the sun threw its lustre on the
pictures, so that they glowed beneath its rays; the
blue sky continued in an endless curve the ultramarine
of the arches; and from the depths of the woods,
where the lofty summits of the trees filled up the
horizon, there seemed to come an echo of flourishes
blown by ivory trumpets, and mythological ballets,
gathering together under the foliage princesses and
nobles disguised as nymphs or fauns&mdash;an epoch of
ingenuous science, of violent passions, and sumptuous
art, when the ideal was to sweep away the world
in a vision of the Hesperides, and when the mistresses
of kings mingled their glory with the stars. There was
a portrait of one of the most beautiful of these celebrated
women in the form of Diana the huntress, and even
the Infernal Diana, no doubt in order to indicate the
power which she possessed even beyond the limits of
the tomb. All these symbols confirmed her glory,
and there remained about the spot something of her,
an indistinct voice, a radiation that stretched out
indefinitely. A feeling of mysterious retrospective
voluptuousness took possession of Frederick.</p>

<p>In order to divert these passionate longings into
another channel, he began to gaze tenderly on Rosanette,
and asked her would she not like to have been
this woman?</p>

<p>"What woman?"</p>

<p>"Diane de Poitiers!"</p>

<p>He repeated:</p>

<p>"Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of Henry II."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave utterance to a little "Ah!" that was all.</p>

<p>Her silence clearly demonstrated that she knew
nothing about the matter, and had failed to comprehend
his meaning, so that out of complaisance he
said to her:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are getting tired of this?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;quite the reverse." And lifting up her
chin, and casting around her a glance of the vaguest
description, Rosanette let these words escape her lips:</p>

<p>"It recalls some memories to me!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was easy to trace on her countenance
a strained expression, a certain sense of awe;
and, as this air of gravity made her look all the prettier,
Frederick overlooked it.</p>

<p>The carps' pond amused her more. For a quarter
of an hour she kept flinging pieces of bread into the
water in order to see the fishes skipping about.</p>

<p>Frederick had seated himself by her side under the
linden-trees. He saw in imagination all the personages
who had haunted these walls&mdash;Charles V., the
Valois Kings, Henry IV., Peter the Great, Jean Jacques
Rousseau, and "the fair mourners of the stage-boxes,"
Voltaire, Napol&eacute;on, Pius VII., and Louis Philippe;
and he felt himself environed, elbowed, by these tumultuous
dead people. He was stunned by such a
confusion of historic figures, even though he found a
certain fascination in contemplating them, nevertheless.</p>

<p>At length they descended into the flower-garden.</p>

<p>It is a vast rectangle, which presents to the spectator,
at the first glance, its wide yellow walks, its
square grass-plots, its ribbons of box-wood, its yew-trees
shaped like pyramids, its low-lying green
swards, and its narrow borders, in which thinly-sown
flowers make spots on the grey soil. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
end of the garden may be seen a park through whose
entire length a canal makes its way.</p>

<p>Royal residences have attached to them a peculiar
kind of melancholy, due, no doubt, to their dimensions
being much too large for the limited number of
guests entertained within them, to the silence which
one feels astonished to find in them after so many
flourishes of trumpets, to the immobility of their
luxurious furniture, which attests by the aspect of
age and decay it gradually assumes the transitory
character of dynasties, the eternal wretchedness of all
things; and this exhalation of the centuries, enervating
and funereal, like the perfume of a mummy,
makes itself felt even in untutored brains. Rosanette
yawned immoderately. They went back to the hotel.</p>

<p>After their breakfast an open carriage came round
for them. They started from Fontainebleau at a point
where several roads diverged, then went up at a
walking pace a gravelly road leading towards a little
pine-wood. The trees became larger, and, from time
to time, the driver would say, "This is the Fr&egrave;res
Siamois, the Pharamond, the Bouquet de Roi," not
forgetting a single one of these notable sites, sometimes
even drawing up to enable them to admire the
scene.</p>

<p>They entered the forest of Franchard. The carriage
glided over the grass like a sledge; pigeons
which they could not see began cooing. Suddenly,
the waiter of a caf&eacute; made his appearance, and they
alighted before the railing of a garden in which a
number of round tables were placed. Then, passing
on the left by the walls of a ruined abbey, they made
their way over big boulders of stone, and soon
reached the lower part of the gorge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>It is covered on one side with sandstones and
juniper-trees tangled together, while on the other side
the ground, almost quite bare, slopes towards the
hollow of the valley, where a foot-track makes a pale
line through the brown heather; and far above could
be traced a flat cone-shaped summit with a telegraph-tower
behind it.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later they stepped out of the vehicle
once more, in order to climb the heights of Aspremont.</p>

<p>The roads form zigzags between the thick-set
pine-trees under rocks with angular faces. All this
corner of the forest has a sort of choked-up look&mdash;a
rather wild and solitary aspect. One thinks of hermits
in connection with it&mdash;companions of huge
stags with fiery crosses between their horns, who
were wont to welcome with paternal smiles the good
kings of France when they knelt before their grottoes.
The warm air was filled with a resinous odour,
and roots of trees crossed one another like veins
close to the soil. Rosanette slipped over them, grew
dejected, and felt inclined to shed tears.</p>

<p>But, at the very top, she became joyous once
more on finding, under a roof made of branches, a
sort of tavern where carved wood was sold. She
drank a bottle of lemonade, and bought a holly-stick;
and, without one glance towards the landscape which
disclosed itself from the plateau, she entered the
Brigands' Cave, with a waiter carrying a torch in
front of her. Their carriage was awaiting them in
the Bas Breau.</p>

<p>A painter in a blue blouse was working at the foot
of an oak-tree with his box of colours on his knees.
He raised his head and watched them as they passed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>In the middle of the hill of Chailly, the sudden
breaking of a cloud caused them to turn up the
hoods of their cloaks. Almost immediately the rain
stopped, and the paving-stones of the street glistened
under the sun when they were re-entering the town.</p>

<p>Some travellers, who had recently arrived, informed
them that a terrible battle had stained Paris
with blood. Rosanette and her lover were not surprised.
Then everybody left; the hotel became quiet,
the gas was put out, and they were lulled to sleep
by the murmur of the fountain in the courtyard.</p>

<p>On the following day they went to see the Wolf's
Gorge, the Fairies' Pool, the Long Rock, and the
<i>Marlotte</i>.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> Two days later, they began again at
random, just as their coachman thought fit to drive
them, without asking where they were, and often
even neglecting the famous sites.</p>

<p>They felt so comfortable in their old landau, low
as a sofa, and covered with a rug made of a striped
material which was quite faded. The moats, filled
with brushwood, stretched out under their eyes with
a gentle, continuous movement. White rays passed
like arrows through the tall ferns. Sometimes a road
that was no longer used presented itself before them,
in a straight line, and here and there might be seen
a feeble growth of weeds. In the centre between
four cross-roads, a crucifix extended its four arms.
In other places, stakes were bending down like dead
trees, and little curved paths, which were lost under
the leaves, made them feel a longing to pursue them.
At the same moment the horse turned round; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
entered there; they plunged into the mire. Further
down moss had sprouted out at the sides of the deep
ruts.</p>

<p>They believed that they were far away from all
other people, quite alone. But suddenly a game-keeper
with his gun, or a band of women in rags
with big bundles of fagots on their backs, would
hurry past them.</p>

<p>When the carriage stopped, there was a universal
silence. The only sounds that reached them were
the blowing of the horse in the shafts with the faint
cry of a bird more than once repeated.</p>

<p>The light at certain points illuminating the outskirts
of the wood, left the interior in deep shadow,
or else, attenuated in the foreground by a sort of
twilight, it exhibited in the background violet vapours,
a white radiance. The midday sun, falling
directly on wide tracts of greenery, made splashes of
light over them, hung gleaming drops of silver from
the ends of the branches, streaked the grass with
long lines of emeralds, and flung gold spots on the
beds of dead leaves. When they let their heads fall
back, they could distinguish the sky through the tops
of the trees. Some of them, which were enormously
high, looked like patriarchs or emperors, or, touching
one another at their extremities formed with their
long shafts, as it were, triumphal arches; others,
sprouting forth obliquely from below, seemed like
falling columns. This heap of big vertical lines gaped
open. Then, enormous green billows unrolled themselves
in unequal embossments as far as the surface
of the valleys, towards which advanced the brows of
other hills looking down on white plains, which ended
by losing themselves in an undefined pale tinge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Standing side by side, on some rising ground, they
felt, as they drank in the air, the pride of a life more
free penetrating into the depths of their souls, with a
superabundance of energy, a joy which they could
not explain.</p>

<p>The variety of trees furnished a spectacle of the
most diversified character. The beeches with their
smooth white bark twisted their tops together. Ash
trees softly curved their bluish branches. In the tufts
of the hornbeams rose up holly stiff as bronze.
Then came a row of thin birches, bent into elegiac
attitudes; and the pine-trees, symmetrical as organ
pipes, seemed to be singing a song as they swayed
to and fro. There were gigantic oaks with knotted
forms, which had been violently shaken, stretched
themselves out from the soil and pressed close against
each other, and with firm trunks resembling torsos,
launched forth to heaven despairing appeals with their
bare arms and furious threats, like a group of Titans
struck motionless in the midst of their rage. An
atmosphere of gloom, a feverish languor, brooded over
the pools, whose sheets of water were cut into flakes
by the overshadowing thorn-trees. The lichens on
their banks, where the wolves come to drink, are of
the colour of sulphur, burnt, as it were, by the footprints
of witches, and the incessant croaking of the
frogs responds to the cawing of the crows as they
wheel through the air. After this they passed through
the monotonous glades, planted here and there with a
staddle. The sound of iron falling with a succession
of rapid blows could be heard. On the side of the
hill a group of quarrymen were breaking the rocks.
These rocks became more and more numerous and
finally filled up the entire landscape, cube-shaped like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
houses, flat like flagstones, propping up, overhanging,
and became intermingled with each other, as if
they were the ruins, unrecognisable and monstrous,
of some vanished city. But the wild chaos they exhibited
made one rather dream of volcanoes, of
deluges, of great unknown cataclysms. Frederick said
they had been there since the beginning of the world,
and would remain so till the end. Rosanette turned
aside her head, declaring that this would drive her
out of her mind, and went off to collect sweet
heather. The little violet blossoms, heaped up near
one another, formed unequal plates, and the soil,
which was giving way underneath, placed soft dark
fringes on the sand spangled with mica.</p>

<p>One day they reached a point half-way up a hill,
where the soil was full of sand. Its surface, untrodden
till now, was streaked so as to resemble
symmetrical waves. Here and there, like promontories
on the dry bed of an ocean, rose up rocks
with the vague outlines of animals, tortoises thrusting
forward their heads, crawling seals, hippopotami, and
bears. Not a soul around them. Not a single sound.
The shingle glowed under the dazzling rays of the
sun, and all at once in this vibration of light the
specimens of the brute creation that met their gaze
began to move about. They returned home quickly,
flying from the dizziness that had seized hold of them,
almost dismayed.</p>

<p>The gravity of the forest exercised an influence
over them, and hours passed in silence, during which,
allowing themselves to yield to the lulling effects of
springs, they remained as it were sunk in the torpor
of a calm intoxication. With his arm around her
waist, he listened to her talking while the birds were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
warbling, noticed with the same glance the black
grapes on her bonnet and the juniper-berries, the
draperies of her veil, and the spiral forms assumed
by the clouds, and when he bent towards her the
freshness of her skin mingled with the strong perfume
of the woods. They found amusement in everything.
They showed one another, as a curiosity,
gossamer threads of the Virgin hanging from bushes,
holes full of water in the middle of stones, a squirrel
on the branches, the way in which two butterflies
kept flying after them; or else, at twenty paces
from them, under the trees, a hind strode on peacefully,
with an air of nobility and gentleness, its doe
walking by its side.</p>

<p>Rosanette would have liked to run after it to embrace
it.</p>

<p>She got very much alarmed once, when a man
suddenly presenting himself, showed her three vipers
in a box. She wildly flung herself on Frederick's
breast. He felt happy at the thought that she was
weak and that he was strong enough to defend her.</p>

<p>That evening they dined at an inn on the banks
of the Seine. The table was near the window, Rosanette
sitting opposite him, and he contemplated her
little well-shaped white nose, her turned-up lips, her
bright eyes, the swelling bands of her nut-brown
hair, and her pretty oval face. Her dress of raw silk
clung to her somewhat drooping shoulders, and her
two hands, emerging from their sleeves, joined
close together as if they were one&mdash;carved, poured
out wine, moved over the table-cloth. The waiters
placed before them a chicken with its four limbs
stretched out, a stew of eels in a dish of pipe-clay,
wine that had got spoiled, bread that was too hard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and knives with notches in them. All these things
made the repast more enjoyable and strengthened the
illusion. They fancied that they were in the middle
of a journey in Italy on their honeymoon. Before
starting again they went for a walk along the bank
of the river.</p>

<p>The soft blue sky, rounded like a dome, leaned
at the horizon on the indentations of the woods.
On the opposite side, at the end of the meadow,
there was a village steeple; and further away, to the
left, the roof of a house made a red spot on the
river, which wound its way without any apparent
motion. Some rushes bent over it, however, and the
water lightly shook some poles fixed at its edge in
order to hold nets. An osier bow-net and two or
three old fishing-boats might be seen there. Near the
inn a girl in a straw hat was drawing buckets out
of a well. Every time they came up again, Frederick
heard the grating sound of the chain with a feeling
of inexpressible delight.</p>

<p>He had no doubt that he would be happy till the
end of his days, so natural did his felicity appear to
him, so much a part of his life, and so intimately
associated with this woman's being. He was irresistibly
impelled to address her with words of endearment.
She answered with pretty little speeches, light
taps on the shoulder, displays of tenderness that
charmed him by their unexpectedness. He discovered
in her quite a new sort of beauty, in fact, which
was perhaps only the reflection of surrounding things,
unless it happened to bud forth from their hidden
potentialities.</p>

<p>When they were lying down in the middle of the
field, he would stretch himself out with his head on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
her lap, under the shelter of her parasol; or else with
their faces turned towards the green sward, in the
centre of which they rested, they kept gazing
towards one another so that their pupils seemed to
intermingle, thirsting for one another and ever satiating
their thirst, and then with half-closed eyelids
they lay side by side without uttering a single word.</p>

<p>Now and then the distant rolling of a drum
reached their ears. It was the signal-drum which
was being beaten in the different villages calling on
people to go and defend Paris.</p>

<p>"Oh! look here! 'tis the rising!" said Frederick,
with a disdainful pity, all this excitement now presenting
to his mind a pitiful aspect by the side of
their love and of eternal nature.</p>

<p>And they talked about whatever happened to
come into their heads, things that were perfectly
familiar to them, persons in whom they took no interest,
a thousand trifles. She chatted with him
about her chambermaid and her hairdresser. One
day she was so self-forgetful that she told him her
age&mdash;twenty-nine years. She was becoming quite
an old woman.</p>

<p>Several times, without intending it, she gave him
some particulars with reference to her own life. She
had been a "shop girl," had taken a trip to England,
and had begun studying for the stage; all this she
told without any explanation of how these changes
had come about; and he found it impossible to reconstruct
her entire history.</p>

<p>She related to him more about herself one day
when they were seated side by side under a plane-tree
at the back of a meadow. At the road-side,
further down, a little barefooted girl, standing amid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a heap of dust, was making a cow go to pasture.
As soon as she caught sight of them she came up
to beg, and while with one hand she held up her
tattered petticoat, she kept scratching with the other
her black hair, which, like a wig of Louis XIV.'s
time, curled round her dark face, lighted by a magnificent
pair of eyes.</p>

<p>"She will be very pretty by-and-by," said Frederick.</p>

<p>"How lucky she is, if she has no mother!" remarked
Rosanette.</p>

<p>"Eh? How is that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I, if it were not for mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She sighed, and began to speak about her childhood.
Her parents were weavers in the Croix-Rousse.
She acted as an apprentice to her father.
In vain did the poor man wear himself out with hard
work; his wife was continually abusing him, and
sold everything for drink. Rosanette could see, as if
it were yesterday, the room they occupied with the
looms ranged lengthwise against the windows, the
pot boiling on the stove, the bed painted like mahogany,
a cupboard facing it, and the obscure loft
where she used to sleep up to the time when she
was fifteen years old. At length a gentleman made
his appearance on the scene&mdash;a fat man with a face
of the colour of boxwood, the manners of a devotee,
and a suit of black clothes. Her mother and this
man had a conversation together, with the result that
three days afterwards&mdash;Rosanette stopped, and with
a look in which there was as much bitterness as
shamelessness:</p>

<p>"It was done!"</p>

<p>Then, in response to a gesture of Frederick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"As he was married (he would have been afraid
of compromising himself in his own house), I was
brought to a private room in a restaurant, and told
that I would be happy, that I would get a handsome
present.</p>

<p>"At the door, the first thing that struck me was
a candelabrum of vermilion on a table, on which
there were two covers. A mirror on the ceiling
showed their reflections, and the blue silk hangings
on the walls made the entire apartment resemble an
alcove; I was seized with astonishment. You understand&mdash;a
poor creature who had never seen anything
before. In spite of my dazed condition of mind, I
got frightened. I wanted to go away. However, I
remained.</p>

<p>"The only seat in the room was a sofa close beside
the table. It was so soft that it gave way under
me. The mouth of the hot-air stove in the middle of
the carpet sent out towards me a warm breath, and
there I sat without taking anything. The waiter,
who was standing near me, urged me to eat. He
poured out for me immediately a large glass of wine.
My head began to swim, I wanted to open the window.
He said to me:</p>

<p>"'No, Mademoiselle! that is forbidden.'"</p>

<p>"And he left me.</p>

<p>"The table was covered with a heap of things
that I had no knowledge of. Nothing there seemed
to me good. Then I fell back on a pot of jam, and
patiently waited. I did not know what prevented
him from coming. It was very late&mdash;midnight at
last&mdash;I couldn't bear the fatigue any longer. While
pushing aside one of the pillows, in order to hear
better, I found under my hand a kind of album&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
book of engravings, they were vulgar pictures. I was
sleeping on top of it when he entered the room."</p>

<p>She hung down her head and remained pensive.</p>

<p>The leaves rustled around them. Amid the tangled
grass a great foxglove was swaying to and fro. The
sunlight flowed like a wave over the green expanse,
and the silence was interrupted at intervals by the
browsing of the cow, which they could no longer see.</p>

<p>Rosanette kept her eyes fixed on a particular spot,
three paces away from her, her nostrils heaving, and
her mind absorbed in thought. Frederick caught
hold of her hand.</p>

<p>"How you suffered, poor darling!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said she, "more than you imagine! So
much so that I wanted to make an end of it&mdash;they
had to fish me up!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Ah! think no more about it! I love you, I am
happy! kiss me!"</p>

<p>And she picked off, one by one, the sprigs of the
thistles which clung to the hem of her gown.</p>

<p>Frederick was thinking more than all on what she
had not told him. What were the means by which
she had gradually emerged from wretchedness? To
what lover did she owe her education? What had
occurred in her life down to the day when he first
came to her house? Her latest avowal was a bar to
these questions. All he asked her was how she had
made Arnoux's acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Through the Vatnaz."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it you that I once saw with both of
them at the Palais-Royal?"</p>

<p>He referred to the exact date. Rosanette made a
movement which showed a sense of deep pain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it is true! I was not gay at that time!"</p>

<p>But Arnoux had proved himself a very good fellow.
Frederick had no doubt of it. However, their
friend was a queer character, full of faults. He took
care to recall them. She quite agreed with him on
this point.</p>

<p>"Never mind! One likes him, all the same, this
camel!"</p>

<p>"Still&mdash;even now?" said Frederick.</p>

<p>She began to redden, half smiling, half angry.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! that's an old story. I don't keep anything
hidden from you. Even though it might be so,
with him it is different. Besides, I don't think you
are nice towards your victim!"</p>

<p>"My victim!"</p>

<p>Rosanette caught hold of his chin.</p>

<p>"No doubt!"</p>

<p>And in the lisping fashion in which nurses talk to
babies:</p>

<p>"Have always been so good! Never went a-by-by
with his wife?"</p>

<p>"I! never at any time!"</p>

<p>Rosanette smiled. He felt hurt by this smile of
hers, which seemed to him a proof of indifference.</p>

<p>But she went on gently, and with one of those
looks which seem to appeal for a denial of the
truth:</p>

<p>"Are you perfectly certain?"</p>

<p>"Not a doubt of it!"</p>

<p>Frederick solemnly declared on his word of honour
that he had never bestowed a thought on Madame
Arnoux, as he was too much in love with another
woman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, with you, my beautiful one!"</p>

<p>"Ah! don't laugh at me! You only annoy me!"</p>

<p>He thought it a prudent course to invent a story&mdash;to
pretend that he was swayed by a passion. He
manufactured some circumstantial details. This woman,
however, had rendered him very unhappy.</p>

<p>"Decidedly, you have not been lucky," said
Rosanette.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! I may have been!" wishing to convey
in this way that he had been often fortunate in his
love-affairs, so that she might have a better opinion
of him, just as Rosanette did not avow how many
lovers she had had, in order that he might have more
respect for her&mdash;for there will always be found in
the midst of the most intimate confidences restrictions,
false shame, delicacy, and pity. You divine
either in the other or in yourself precipices or miry
paths which prevent you from penetrating any farther;
moreover, you feel that you will not be understood.
It is hard to express accurately the thing you mean,
whatever it may be; and this is the reason why perfect
unions are rare.</p>

<p>The poor Mar&eacute;chale had never known one better
than this. Often, when she gazed at Frederick, tears
came into her eyes; then she would raise them or
cast a glance towards the horizon, as if she saw
there some bright dawn, perspectives of boundless
felicity. At last, she confessed one day to him that
she wished to have a mass said, "so that it might
bring a blessing on our love."</p>

<p>How was it, then, that she had resisted him so
long? She could not tell herself. He repeated his
question a great many times; and she replied, as she
clasped him in her arms:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was because I was afraid, my darling, of loving
you too well!"</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, Frederick read, amongst the
list of the wounded given in a newspaper, the name
of Dussardier. He uttered a cry, and showing the
paper to Rosanette, declared that he was going to
start at once for Paris.</p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>"In order to see him, to nurse him!"</p>

<p>"You are not going, I'm sure, to leave me by
myself?"</p>

<p>"Come with me!"</p>

<p>"Ha! to poke my nose in a squabble of that sort?
Oh, no, thanks!"</p>

<p>"However, I cannot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ta! ta! ta! as if they had need of nurses in
the hospitals! And then, what concern is he of
yours any longer? Everyone for himself!"</p>

<p>He was roused to indignation by this egoism on
her part, and he reproached himself for not being in
the capital with the others. Such indifference to the
misfortunes of the nation had in it something shabby,
and only worthy of a small shopkeeper. And now,
all of a sudden, his intrigue with Rosanette weighed
on his mind as if it were a crime. For an hour they
were quite cool towards each other.</p>

<p>Then she appealed to him to wait, and not expose
himself to danger.</p>

<p>"Suppose you happen to be killed?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should only have done my duty!"</p>

<p>Rosanette gave a jump. His first duty was to
love her; but, no doubt, he did not care about her
any longer. There was no common sense in what
he was going to do. Good heavens! what an idea!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick rang for his bill. But to get back to
Pans was not an easy matter. The Leloir stagecoach
had just left; the Lecomte berlins would not
be starting; the diligence from Bourbonnais would
not be passing till a late hour that night, and perhaps
it might be full, one could never tell. When he had
lost a great deal of time in making enquiries about
the various modes of conveyance, the idea occurred
to him to travel post. The master of the post-house
refused to supply him with horses, as Frederick had
no passport. Finally, he hired an open carriage&mdash;the
same one in which they had driven about the country&mdash;and
at about five o'clock they arrived in front
of the H&ocirc;tel du Commerce at Melun.</p>

<p>The market-place was covered with piles of arms.
The prefect had forbidden the National Guards to
proceed towards Paris. Those who did not belong
to his department wished to go on. There was a
great deal of shouting, and the inn was packed with
a noisy crowd.</p>

<p>Rosanette, seized with terror, said she would not
go a step further, and once more begged of him to
stay. The innkeeper and his wife joined in her entreaties.
A decent sort of man who happened to be
dining there interposed, and observed that the fighting
would be over in a very short time. Besides,
one ought to do his duty. Thereupon the Mar&eacute;chale
redoubled her sobs. Frederick got exasperated. He
handed her his purse, kissed her quickly, and disappeared.</p>

<p>On reaching Corbeil, he learned at the station that
the insurgents had cut the rails at regular distances,
and the coachman refused to drive him any farther;
he said that his horses were "overspent."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Through his influence, however, Frederick managed
to procure an indifferent cabriolet, which, for
the sum of sixty francs, without taking into account
the price of a drink for the driver, was to convey
him as far as the Italian barrier. But at a hundred
paces from the barrier his coachman made him descend
and turn back. Frederick was walking along
the pathway, when suddenly a sentinel thrust out his
bayonet. Four men seized him, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"This is one of them! Look out! Search him!
Brigand! scoundrel!"</p>

<p>And he was so thoroughly stupefied that he let
himself be dragged to the guard-house of the barrier,
at the very point where the Boulevards des Gobelins
and de l'H&ocirc;pital and Rues Godefroy and Mauffetard
converge.</p>

<p>Four barricades formed at the ends of four different
ways enormous sloping ramparts of paving-stones.
Torches were glimmering here and there. In spite
of the rising clouds of dust he could distinguish foot-soldiers
of the Line and National Guards, all with
their faces blackened, their chests uncovered, and an
aspect of wild excitement. They had just captured
the square, and had shot down a number of men.
Their rage had not yet cooled. Frederick said he had
come from Fontainebleau to the relief of a wounded
comrade who lodged in the Rue Bellefond. Not one
of them would believe him at first. They examined
his hands; they even put their noses to his ear to
make sure that he did not smell of powder.</p>

<p>However, by dint of repeating the same thing, he
finally satisfied a captain, who directed two fusiliers
to conduct him to the guard-house of the Jardin des
Plantes. They descended the Boulevard de l'H&ocirc;pital.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
A strong breeze was blowing. It restored him to
animation.</p>

<p>After this they turned up the Rue du March&eacute; aux
Chevaux. The Jardin des Plantes at the right formed
a long black mass, whilst at the left the entire front
of the Piti&eacute;, illuminated at every window, blazed like
a conflagration, and shadows passed rapidly over the
window-panes.</p>

<p>The two men in charge of Frederick went away.
Another accompanied him to the Polytechnic School.
The Rue Saint-Victor was quite dark, without a gas-lamp
or a light at any window to relieve the gloom.
Every ten minutes could be heard the words:</p>

<p>"Sentinels! mind yourselves!"</p>

<p>And this exclamation, cast into the midst of the
silence, was prolonged like the repeated striking of a
stone against the side of a chasm as it falls through
space.</p>

<p>Every now and then the stamp of heavy footsteps
could be heard drawing nearer. This was
nothing less than a patrol consisting of about a hundred
men. From this confused mass escaped whisperings
and the dull clanking of iron; and, moving
away with a rhythmic swing, it melted into the
darkness.</p>

<p>In the middle of the crossing, where several
streets met, a dragoon sat motionless on his horse.
From time to time an express rider passed at a rapid
gallop; then the silence was renewed. Cannons,
which were being drawn along the streets, made, on
the pavement, a heavy rolling sound that seemed
full of menace&mdash;a sound different from every ordinary
sound&mdash;which oppressed the heart. The sounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was profound, unlimited&mdash;a black silence. Men in
white blouses accosted the soldiers, spoke one or two
words to them, and then vanished like phantoms.</p>

<p>The guard-house of the Polytechnic School overflowed
with people. The threshold was blocked up
with women, who had come to see their sons or
their husbands. They were sent on to the Panth&eacute;on,
which had been transformed into a dead-house; and
no attention was paid to Frederick. He pressed forward
resolutely, solemnly declaring that his friend
Dussardier was waiting for him, that he was at
death's door. At last they sent a corporal to accompany
him to the top of the Rue Saint-Jacques, to the
Mayor's office in the twelfth arrondissement.</p>

<p>The Place du Panth&eacute;on was filled with soldiers
lying asleep on straw. The day was breaking; the
bivouac-fires were extinguished.</p>

<p>The insurrection had left terrible traces in this
quarter. The soil of the streets, from one end to the
other, was covered with risings of various sizes. On
the wrecked barricades had been piled up omnibuses,
gas-pipes, and cart-wheels. In certain places there
were little dark pools, which must have been blood.
The houses were riddled with projectiles, and their
framework could be seen under the plaster that
was peeled off. Window-blinds, each attached only
by a single nail, hung like rags. The staircases having
fallen in, doors opened on vacancy. The interiors
of rooms could be perceived with their papers
in strips. In some instances dainty objects had remained
in them quite intact. Frederick noticed a
timepiece, a parrot-stick, and some engravings.</p>

<p>When he entered the Mayor's office, the National
Guards were chattering without a moment's pause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
about the deaths of Br&eacute;a and N&eacute;grier, about the
deputy Charbonnel, and about the Archbishop of
Paris. He heard them saying that the Duc d'Aumale
had landed at Boulogne, that Barb&egrave;s had fled from
Vincennes, that the artillery were coming up from
Bourges, and that abundant aid was arriving from the
provinces. About three o'clock some one brought
good news.</p>

<p>Truce-bearers from the insurgents were in conference
with the President of the Assembly.</p>

<p>Thereupon they all made merry; and as he had a
dozen francs left, Frederick sent for a dozen bottles
of wine, hoping by this means to hasten his deliverance.
Suddenly a discharge of musketry was heard.
The drinking stopped. They peered with distrustful
eyes into the unknown&mdash;it might be Henry V.</p>

<p>In order to get rid of responsibility, they took
Frederick to the Mayor's office in the eleventh arrondissement,
which he was not permitted to leave
till nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>He started at a running pace from the Quai Voltaire.
At an open window an old man in his shirt-sleeves
was crying, with his eyes raised. The Seine
glided peacefully along. The sky was of a clear blue;
and in the trees round the Tuileries birds were singing.</p>

<p>Frederick was just crossing the Place du Carrousel
when a litter happened to be passing by. The soldiers
at the guard-house immediately presented arms;
and the officer, putting his hand to his shako, said:
"Honour to unfortunate bravery!" This phrase
seemed to have almost become a matter of duty. He
who pronounced it appeared to be, on each occasion,
filled with profound emotion. A group of people in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
state of fierce excitement followed the litter, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"We will avenge you! we will avenge you!"</p>

<p>The vehicles kept moving about on the boulevard,
and women were making lint before the doors.
Meanwhile, the outbreak had been quelled, or very
nearly so. A proclamation from Cavaignac, just
posted up, announced the fact. At the top of the
Rue Vivienne, a company of the Garde Mobile appeared.
Then the citizens uttered cries of enthusiasm.
They raised their hats, applauded, danced,
wished to embrace them, and to invite them to
drink; and flowers, flung by ladies, fell from the balconies.</p>

<p>At last, at ten o'clock, at the moment when the
cannon was booming as an attack was being made
on the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Frederick reached the
abode of Dussardier. He found the bookkeeper in his
garret, lying asleep on his back. From the adjoining
apartment a woman came forth with silent tread&mdash;Mademoiselle
Vatnaz.</p>

<p>She led Frederick aside and explained to him how
Dussardier had got wounded.</p>

<p>On Saturday, on the top of a barricade in the Rue
Lafayette, a young fellow wrapped in a tricoloured
flag cried out to the National Guards: "Are you going
to shoot your brothers?" As they advanced,
Dussardier threw down his gun, pushed away the
others, sprang over the barricade, and, with a blow
of an old shoe, knocked down the insurgent, from
whom he tore the flag. He had afterwards been
found under a heap of rubbish with a slug of copper
in his thigh. It was found necessary to make an incision
in order to extract the projectile. Mademoiselle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Vatnaz arrived the same evening, and since then had
not quitted his side.</p>

<p>She intelligently prepared everything that was
needed for the dressings, assisted him in taking his
medicine or other liquids, attended to his slightest
wishes, left and returned again with footsteps more
light than those of a fly, and gazed at him with eyes
full of tenderness.</p>

<p>Frederick, during the two following weeks, did
not fail to come back every morning. One day,
while he was speaking about the devotion of the
Vatnaz, Dussardier shrugged his shoulders:</p>

<p>"Oh! no! she does this through interested motives."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>He replied: "I am sure of it!" without seeming
disposed to give any further explanation.</p>

<p>She had loaded him with kindnesses, carrying her
attentions so far as to bring him the newspapers in
which his gallant action was extolled. He even confessed
to Frederick that he felt uneasy in his conscience.</p>

<p>Perhaps he ought to have put himself on the other
side with the men in blouses; for, indeed, a heap of
promises had been made to them which had not
been carried out. Those who had vanquished them
hated the Republic; and, in the next place, they had
treated them very harshly. No doubt they were
in the wrong&mdash;not quite, however; and the honest
fellow was tormented by the thought that he might
have fought against the righteous cause. S&eacute;n&eacute;cal,
who was immured in the Tuileries, under the terrace
at the water's edge, had none of this mental
anguish.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>There were nine hundred men in the place, huddled
together in the midst of filth, without the slightest
order, their faces blackened with powder and
clotted blood, shivering with ague and breaking out
into cries of rage, and those who were brought there
to die were not separated from the rest. Sometimes,
on hearing the sound of a detonation, they believed
that they were all going to be shot. Then they
dashed themselves against the walls, and after that
fell back again into their places, so much stupefied
by suffering that it seemed to them that they were
living in a nightmare, a mournful hallucination. The
lamp, which hung from the arched roof, looked like
a stain of blood, and little green and yellow flames
fluttered about, caused by the emanations from the
vault. Through fear of epidemics, a commission was
appointed. When he had advanced a few steps, the
President recoiled, frightened by the stench from the
excrements and from the corpses.</p>

<p>As soon as the prisoners drew near a vent-hole,
the National Guards who were on sentry, in order to
prevent them from shaking the bars of the grating,
prodded them indiscriminately with their bayonets.</p>

<p>As a rule they showed no pity. Those who were
not beaten wished to signalise themselves. There
was a regular outbreak of fear. They avenged themselves
at the same time on newspapers, clubs, mobs,
speech-making&mdash;everything that had exasperated them
during the last three months, and in spite of the victory
that had been gained, equality (as if for the
punishment of its defenders and the exposure of its
enemies to ridicule) manifested itself in a triumphal
fashion&mdash;an equality of brute beasts, a dead level of
sanguinary vileness; for the fanaticism of self-interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
balanced the madness of want, aristocracy had the
same fits of fury as low debauchery, and the cotton
cap did not show itself less hideous than the red cap.
The public mind was agitated just as it would be
after great convulsions of nature. Sensible men were
rendered imbeciles for the rest of their lives on account
of it.</p>

<p>P&egrave;re Roque had become very courageous, almost
foolhardy. Having arrived on the 26th at Paris with
some of the inhabitants of Nogent, instead of going
back at the same time with them, he had gone to
give his assistance to the National Guard encamped
at the Tuileries; and he was quite satisfied to be
placed on sentry in front of the terrace at the water's
side. There, at any rate, he had these brigands under
his feet! He was delighted to find that they were
beaten and humiliated, and he could not refrain from
uttering invectives against them.</p>

<p>One of them, a young lad with long fair hair, put
his face to the bars, and asked for bread. M. Roque
ordered him to hold his tongue. But the young man
repeated in a mournful tone:</p>

<p>"Bread!"</p>

<p>"Have I any to give you?"</p>

<p>Other prisoners presented themselves at the vent-hole,
with their bristling beards, their burning eyeballs,
all pushing forward, and yelling:</p>

<p>"Bread!"</p>

<p>P&egrave;re Roque was indignant at seeing his authority
slighted. In order to frighten them he took aim at
them; and, borne onward into the vault by the crush
that nearly smothered him, the young man, with his
head thrown backward, once more exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Bread!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hold on! here it is!" said P&egrave;re Roque, firing a
shot from his gun. There was a fearful howl&mdash;then,
silence. At the side of the trough something white
could be seen lying.</p>

<p>After this, M. Roque returned to his abode, for he
had a house in the Rue Saint-Martin, which he used
as a temporary residence; and the injury done to the
front of the building during the riots had in no slight
degree contributed to excite his rage. It seemed to
him, when he next saw it, that he had exaggerated
the amount of damage done to it. His recent act had
a soothing effect on him, as if it indemnified him for
his loss.</p>

<p>It was his daughter herself who opened the door
for him. She immediately made the remark that she
had felt uneasy at his excessively prolonged absence.
She was afraid that he had met with some misfortune&mdash;that
he had been wounded.</p>

<p>This manifestation of filial love softened P&egrave;re
Roque. He was astonished that she should have set
out on a journey without Catherine.</p>

<p>"I sent her out on a message," was Louise's
reply.</p>

<p>And she made enquiries about his health, about
one thing or another; then, with an air of indifference,
she asked him whether he had chanced to come
across Frederick:</p>

<p>"No; I didn't see him!"</p>

<p>It was on his account alone that she had come
up from the country.</p>

<p>Some one was walking at that moment in the
lobby.</p>

<p>"Oh! excuse me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And she disappeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Catherine had not found Frederick. He had been
several days away, and his intimate friend, M. Deslauriers,
was now living in the provinces.</p>

<p>Louise once more presented herself, shaking all
over, without being able to utter a word. She leaned
against the furniture.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you? Tell me&mdash;what's
the matter with you?" exclaimed her father.</p>

<p>She indicated by a wave of her hand that it was
nothing, and with a great effort of will she regained
her composure.</p>

<p>The keeper of the restaurant at the opposite side
of the street brought them soup. But P&egrave;re Roque had
passed through too exciting an ordeal to be able to
control his emotions. "He is not likely to die;" and
at dessert he had a sort of fainting fit. A doctor was
at once sent for, and he prescribed a potion. Then,
when M. Roque was in bed, he asked to be as well
wrapped up as possible in order to bring on perspiration.
He gasped; he moaned.</p>

<p>"Thanks, my good Catherine! Kiss your poor
father, my chicken! Ah! those revolutions!"</p>

<p>And, when his daughter scolded him for having
made himself ill by tormenting his mind on her account,
he replied:</p>

<p>"Yes! you are right! But I couldn't help it! I
am too sensitive!"</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="chapter_xv" id="chapter_xv"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">"How Happy Could I Be With Either."</h3>


<p><img src="images/i_chxv.png" width="120" height="125" alt="M" title="" class="illodrop" style="margin-top: -4em;" />adame Dambreuse, in her boudoir,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
between her niece and Miss John,
was listening to M. Roque as he
described the severe military duties
he had been forced to perform.</p>

<p>She was biting her lips, and appeared
to be in pain.</p>

<p>"Oh! 'tis nothing! it will pass away!"</p>

<p>And, with a gracious air:</p>

<p>"We are going to have an acquaintance of yours
at dinner with us,&mdash;Monsieur Moreau."</p>

<p>Louise gave a start.</p>

<p>"Oh! we'll only have a few intimate friends there&mdash;amongst
others, Alfred de Cisy."</p>

<p>And she spoke in terms of high praise about his manners,
his personal appearance, and especially his moral
character.</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse was nearer to a correct estimate
of the state of affairs than she imagined; the
Vicomte was contemplating marriage. He said so to
Martinon, adding that Mademoiselle C&eacute;cile was certain
to like him, and that her parents would accept
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>To warrant him in going so far as to confide to
another his intentions on the point, he ought to have
satisfactory information with regard to her dowry.
Now Martinon had a suspicion that C&eacute;cile was M.
Dambreuse's natural daughter; and it is probable that
it would have been a very strong step on his part to
ask for her hand at any risk. Such audacity, of
course, was not unaccompanied by danger; and for
this reason Martinon had, up to the present, acted in
a way that could not compromise him. Besides, he
did not see how he could well get rid of the aunt.
Cisy's confidence induced him to make up his mind;
and he had formally made his proposal to the banker,
who, seeing no obstacle to it, had just informed
Madame Dambreuse about the matter.</p>

<p>Cisy presently made his appearance. She arose
and said:</p>

<p>"You have forgotten us. C&eacute;cile, shake hands!"</p>

<p>At the same moment Frederick entered the room.</p>

<p>"Ha! at last we have found you again!" exclaimed
P&egrave;re Roque. "I called with C&eacute;cile on you three
times this week!"</p>

<p>Frederick had carefully avoided them. He pleaded
by way of excuse that he spent all his days beside a
wounded comrade.</p>

<p>For a long time, however, a heap of misfortunes
had happened to him, and he tried to invent stories
to explain his conduct. Luckily the guests arrived in
the midst of his explanation. First of all M. Paul de
Gr&eacute;monville, the diplomatist whom he met at the
ball; then Fumichon, that manufacturer whose conservative
zeal had scandalised him one evening.
After them came the old Duchesse de Montreuil
Nantua.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>But two loud voices in the anteroom reached his
ears. They were that of M. de Nonancourt, an old
beau with the air of a mummy preserved in cold
cream, and that of Madame de Larsillois, the wife of
a prefect of Louis Philippe. She was terribly frightened,
for she had just heard an organ playing a polka
which was a signal amongst the insurgents. Many
of the wealthy class of citizens had similar apprehensions;
they thought that men in the catacombs were
going to blow up the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Some
noises escaped from cellars, and things that excited
suspicion were passed up to windows.</p>

<p>Everyone in the meantime made an effort to calm
Madame de Larsillois. Order was re-established.
There was no longer anything to fear.</p>

<p>"Cavaignac has saved us!"</p>

<p>As if the horrors of the insurrection had not been
sufficiently numerous, they exaggerated them. There
had been twenty-three thousand convicts on the side
of the Socialists&mdash;no less!</p>

<p>They had no doubt whatever that food had been
poisoned, that Gardes Mobiles had been sawn between
two planks, and that there had been inscriptions
on flags inciting the people to pillage and
incendiarism.</p>

<p>"Aye, and something more!" added the ex-prefect.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Madame Dambreuse, whose
modesty was shocked, while she indicated the three
young girls with a glance.</p>

<p>M. Dambreuse came forth from his study accompanied
by Martinon. She turned her head round and
responded to a bow from Pellerin, who was advancing
towards her. The artist gazed in a restless
fashion towards the walls. The banker took him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
aside, and conveyed to him that it was desirable for
the present to conceal his revolutionary picture.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Pellerin, the rebuff which he received
at the Club of Intellect having modified his
opinions.</p>

<p>M. Dambreuse let it slip out very politely that he
would give him orders for other works.</p>

<p>"But excuse me. Ah! my dear friend, what a
pleasure!"</p>

<p>Arnoux and Madame Arnoux stood before Frederick.</p>

<p>He had a sort of vertigo. Rosanette had been
irritating him all the afternoon with her display of
admiration for soldiers, and the old passion was re-awakened.</p>

<p>The steward came to announce that dinner was
on the table. With a look she directed the Vicomte
to take C&eacute;cile's arm, while she said in a low tone to
Martinon, "You wretch!" And then they passed
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>Under the green leaves of a pineapple, in the
middle of the table-cloth, a dorado stood, with its
snout reaching towards a quarter of roebuck and its
tail just grazing a bushy dish of crayfish. Figs, huge
cherries, pears, and grapes (the first fruits of Parisian
cultivation) rose like pyramids in baskets of old
Saxe. Here and there a bunch of flowers mingled
with the shining silver plate. The white silk blinds,
drawn down in front of the windows, filled the
apartment with a mellow light. It was cooled by
two fountains, in which there were pieces of ice; and
tall men-servants, in short breeches, waited on them.
All these luxuries seemed more precious after the
emotion of the past few days. They felt a fresh de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>light
at possessing things which they had been afraid
of losing; and Nonancourt expressed the general sentiment
when he said:</p>

<p>"Ah! let us hope that these Republican gentlemen
will allow us to dine!"</p>

<p>"In spite of their fraternity!" P&egrave;re Roque added,
with an attempt at wit.</p>

<p>These two personages were placed respectively at
the right and at the left of Madame Dambreuse, her
husband being exactly opposite her, between Madame
Larsillois, at whose side was the diplomatist and the
old Duchesse, whom Fumichon elbowed. Then came
the painter, the dealer in fa&iuml;ence, and Mademoiselle
Louise; and, thanks to Martinon, who had carried her
chair to enable her to take a seat near Louise, Frederick
found himself beside Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>She wore a black bar&egrave;ge gown, a gold hoop on
her wrist, and, as on the first day that he dined at
her house, something red in her hair, a branch of
fuchsia twisted round her chignon. He could not
help saying:</p>

<p>"'Tis a long time since we saw each other."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she returned coldly.</p>

<p>He went on, in a mild tone, which mitigated the
impertinence of his question:</p>

<p>"Have you thought of me now and then?"</p>

<p>"Why should I think of you?"</p>

<p>Frederick was hurt by these words.</p>

<p>"You are right, perhaps, after all."</p>

<p>But very soon, regretting what he had said, he
swore that he had not lived a single day without being
ravaged by the remembrance of her.</p>

<p>"I don't believe a single word of it, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"However, you know that I love you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Arnoux made no reply.</p>

<p>"You know that I love you!"</p>

<p>She still kept silent.</p>

<p>"Well, then, go be hanged!" said Frederick to
himself.</p>

<p>And, as he raised his eyes, he perceived Mademoiselle
Roque at the other side of Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>She thought it gave her a coquettish look to dress
entirely in green, a colour which contrasted horribly
with her red hair. The buckle of her belt was large
and her collar cramped her neck. This lack of elegance
had, no doubt, contributed to the coldness which
Frederick at first displayed towards her. She watched
him from where she sat, some distance away from
him, with curious glances; and Arnoux, close to her
side, in vain lavished his gallantries&mdash;he could not get
her to utter three words, so that, finally abandoning
all hope of making himself agreeable to her, he listened
to the conversation. She now began rolling about a
slice of Luxembourg pineapple in her pea-soup.</p>

<p>Louis Blanc, according to Fumichon, owned a large
house in the Rue Saint-Dominique, which he refused
to let to the workmen.</p>

<p>"For my part, I think it rather a funny thing,"
said Nonancourt, "to see Ledru-Rollin hunting over
the Crown lands."</p>

<p>"He owes twenty thousand francs to a goldsmith!"
Cisy interposed, "and 'tis maintained&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Madame Darnbreuse stopped him.</p>

<p>"Ah! how nasty it is to be getting hot about
politics! and for such a young man, too! fie, fie!
Pay attention rather to your fair neighbour!"</p>

<p>After this, those who were of a grave turn of
mind attacked the newspapers. Arnoux took it on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
himself to defend them. Frederick mixed himself up
in the discussion, describing them as commercial establishments
just like any other house of business.
Those who wrote for them were, as a rule, imbeciles
or humbugs; he gave his listeners to understand that
he was acquainted with journalists, and combated
with sarcasms his friend's generous sentiments.</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux did not notice that this was said
through a feeling of spite against her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Vicomte was torturing his brain in
the effort to make a conquest of Mademoiselle C&eacute;cile.
He commenced by finding fault with the shape of the
decanters and the graving of the knives, in order to
show his artistic tastes. Then he talked about his
stable, his tailor and his shirtmaker. Finally, he took
up the subject of religion, and seized the opportunity
of conveying to her that he fulfilled all his duties.</p>

<p>Martinon set to work in a better fashion. With
his eyes fixed on her continually, he praised, in a
monotonous fashion, her birdlike profile, her dull fair
hair, and her hands, which were unusually short.
The plain-looking young girl was delighted at this
shower of flatteries.</p>

<p>It was impossible to hear anything, as all present
were talking at the tops of their voices. M. Roque
wanted "an iron hand" to govern France. Nonancourt
even regretted that the political scaffold was
abolished. They ought to have all these scoundrels
put to death together.</p>

<p>"Now that I think of it, are we speaking of
Dussardier?" said M. Dambreuse, turning towards
Frederick.</p>

<p>The worthy shopman was now a hero, like Sallesse,
the brothers Jeanson, the wife of Pequillet, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick, without waiting to be asked, related
his friend's history; it threw around him a kind of
halo.</p>

<p>Then they came quite naturally to refer to different
traits of courage.</p>

<p>According to the diplomatist, it was not hard to
face death, witness the case of men who fight duels.</p>

<p>"We might take the Vicomte's testimony on that
point," said Martinon.</p>

<p>The Vicomte's face got very flushed.</p>

<p>The guests stared at him, and Louise, more astonished
than the rest, murmured:</p>

<p>"What is it, pray?"</p>

<p>"He <i>sank</i> before Frederick," returned Arnoux, in
a very low tone.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything, Mademoiselle?" said
Nonancourt presently, and he repeated her answer to
Madame Dambreuse, who, bending forward a little,
began to fix her gaze on Frederick.</p>

<p>Martinon did not wait for C&eacute;cile's questions. He
informed her that this affair had reference to a woman
of improper character. The young girl drew back
slightly in her chair, as if to escape from contact with
such a libertine.</p>

<p>The conversation was renewed. The great wines
of Bordeaux were sent round, and the guests became
animated. Pellerin had a dislike to the Revolution,
because he attributed to it the complete loss of the
Spanish Museum.</p>

<p>This is what grieved him most as a painter.</p>

<p>As he made the latter remark, M. Roque asked:</p>

<p>"Are you not yourself the painter of a very notable
picture?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps! What is it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"It represents a lady in a costume&mdash;faith!&mdash;a little
light, with a purse, and a peacock behind."</p>

<p>Frederick, in his turn, reddened. Pellerin pretended
that he had not heard the words.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, it is certainly by you! For your
name is written at the bottom of it, and there is a
line on it stating that it is Monsieur Moreau's property."</p>

<p>One day, when P&egrave;re Roque and his daughter were
waiting at his residence to see him, they saw the
Mar&eacute;chale's portrait. The old gentleman had even
taken it for "a Gothic painting."</p>

<p>"No," said Pellerin rudely, "'tis a woman's portrait."</p>

<p>Martinon added:</p>

<p>"And a living woman's, too, and no mistake!
Isn't that so, Cisy?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I know nothing about it."</p>

<p>"I thought you were acquainted with her. But,
since it causes you pain, I must beg a thousand pardons!"</p>

<p>Cisy lowered his eyes, proving by his embarrassment
that he must have played a pitiable part in connection
with this portrait. As for Frederick, the model
could only be his mistress. It was one of those convictions
which are immediately formed, and the faces
of the assembly revealed it with the utmost clearness.</p>

<p>"How he lied to me!" said Madame Arnoux to
herself.</p>

<p>"It is for her, then, that he left me," thought
Louise.</p>

<p>Frederick had an idea that these two stories might
compromise him; and when they were in the garden,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Mademoiselle C&eacute;cile's wooer burst out laughing in
his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all! 'twill do you good! Go ahead!"</p>

<p>What did he mean? Besides, what was the cause
of this good nature, so contrary to his usual conduct?
Without giving any explanation, he proceeded
towards the lower end, where the ladies were seated.
The men were standing round them, and, in their
midst, Pellerin was giving vent to his ideas. The
form of government most favourable for the arts was
an enlightened monarchy. He was disgusted with
modern times, "if it were only on account of the
National Guard"&mdash;he regretted the Middle Ages and
the days of Louis XIV. M. Roque congratulated him
on his opinions, confessing that they overcame all his
prejudices against artists. But almost without a
moment's delay he went off when the voice of Fumichon
attracted his attention.</p>

<p>Arnoux tried to prove that there were two Socialisms&mdash;a
good and a bad. The manufacturer saw no
difference whatever between them, his head becoming
dizzy with rage at the utterance of the word "property."</p>

<p>"'Tis a law written on the face of Nature! Children
cling to their toys. All peoples, all animals are
of my opinion. The lion even, if he were able to
speak, would declare himself a proprietor! Thus I
myself, messieurs, began with a capital of fifteen
thousand francs. Would you be surprised to hear
that for thirty years I used to get up at four o'clock
every morning? I've had as much pain as five hundred
devils in making my fortune! And people will
come and tell me I'm not the master, that my money
is not my money; in short, that property is theft!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Proudhon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me alone with your Proudhon! if he were
here I think I'd strangle him!"</p>

<p>He would have strangled him. After the intoxicating
drink he had swallowed Fumichon did not know
what he was talking about any longer, and his apoplectic
face was on the point of bursting like a bombshell.</p>

<p>"Good morrow, Arnoux," said Hussonnet, who
was walking briskly over the grass.</p>

<p>He brought M. Dambreuse the first leaf of a
pamphlet, bearing the title of "The Hydra," the
Bohemian defending the interests of a reactionary club,
and in that capacity he was introduced by the banker
to his guests.</p>

<p>Hussonnet amused them by relating how the dealers
in tallow hired three hundred and ninety-two street
boys to bawl out every evening "Lamps,"<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> and then
turning into ridicule the principles of '89, the emancipation
of the negroes, and the orators of the Left;
and he even went so far as to do "Prudhomme on
a Barricade," perhaps under the influence of a kind of
jealousy of these rich people who had enjoyed a good
dinner. The caricature did not please them overmuch.
Their faces grew long.</p>

<p>This, however, was not a time for joking, so
Nonancourt observed, as he recalled the death of
Monseigneur Affre and that of General de Br&eacute;a.
These events were being constantly alluded to, and
arguments were constructed out of them. M. Roque
described the archbishop's end as "everything that
one could call sublime." Fumichon gave the palm to
the military personage, and instead of simply ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>pressing
regret for these two murders, they held disputes
with a view to determining which ought to
excite the greatest indignation. A second comparison
was next instituted, namely, between Lamorici&egrave;re and
Cavaignac, M. Dambreuse glorifying Cavaignac, and
Nonancourt, Lamorici&egrave;re.</p>

<p>Not one of the persons present, with the exception
of Arnoux, had ever seen either of them engaged in
the exercise of his profession. None the less, everyone
formulated an irrevocable judgment with reference
to their operations.</p>

<p>Frederick, however, declined to give an opinion on
the matter, confessing that he had not served as a
soldier. The diplomatist and M. Dambreuse gave him
an approving nod of the head. In fact, to have
fought against the insurrection was to have defended
the Republic. The result, although favourable, consolidated
it; and now they had got rid of the vanquished,
they wanted to be conquerors.</p>

<p>As soon as they had got out into the garden,
Madame Dambreuse, taking Cisy aside, chided him
for his awkwardness. When she caught sight of
Martinon, she sent him away, and then tried to learn
from her future nephew the cause of his witticisms
at the Vicomte's expense.</p>

<p>"There's nothing of the kind."</p>

<p>"And all this, as it were, for the glory of M.
Moreau. What is the object of it?"</p>

<p>"There's no object. Frederick is a charming fellow.
I am very fond of him."</p>

<p>"And so am I, too. Let him come here. Go and
look for him!"</p>

<p>After two or three commonplace phrases, she began
by lightly disparaging her guests, and in this way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
she placed him on a higher level than the others.
He did not fail to run down the rest of the ladies
more or less, which was an ingenious way of paying
her compliments. But she left his side from time to
time, as it was a reception-night, and ladies were
every moment arriving; then she returned to her seat,
and the entirely accidental arrangement of the chairs
enabled them to avoid being overheard.</p>

<p>She showed herself playful and yet grave, melancholy
and yet quite rational. Her daily occupations
interested her very little&mdash;there was an order of sentiments
of a less transitory kind. She complained of
the poets, who misrepresent the facts of life, then she
raised her eyes towards heaven, asking of him what
was the name of a star.</p>

<p>Two or three Chinese lanterns had been suspended
from the trees; the wind shook them, and lines of
coloured light quivered on her white dress. She sat,
after her usual fashion, a little back in her armchair,
with a footstool in front of her. The tip of a black
satin shoe could be seen; and at intervals Madame
Dambreuse allowed a louder word than usual, and
sometimes even a laugh, to escape her.</p>

<p>These coquetries did not affect Martinon, who was
occupied with C&eacute;cile; but they were bound to make
an impression on M. Roque's daughter, who was
chatting with Madame Arnoux. She was the only
member of her own sex present whose manners did
not appear disdainful. Louise came and sat beside
her; then, yielding to the desire to give vent to her
emotions:</p>

<p>"Does he not talk well&mdash;Frederick Moreau, I
mean?"</p>

<p>"Do you know him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! intimately! We are neighbours; and he used
to amuse himself with me when I was quite a little
girl."</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux cast at her a sidelong glance,
which meant:</p>

<p>"I suppose you are not in love with him?"</p>

<p>The young girl's face replied with an untroubled
look:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You see him often, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! only when he comes to his mother's
house. 'Tis ten months now since he came. He
promised, however, to be more particular."</p>

<p>"The promises of men are not to be too much relied
on, my child."</p>

<p>"But he has not deceived me!"</p>

<p>"As he did others!"</p>

<p>Louise shivered: "Can it be by any chance that
he promised something to her;" and her features became
distracted with distrust and hate.</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux was almost afraid of her; she
would have gladly withdrawn what she had said.
Then both became silent.</p>

<p>As Frederick was sitting opposite them on a folding-stool,
they kept staring at him, the one with propriety
out of the corner of her eye, the other boldly, with
parted lips, so that Madame Dambreuse said to him:</p>

<p>"Come, now, turn round, and let her have a good
look at you!"</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, Monsieur Roque's daughter!"</p>

<p>And she rallied him on having won the heart of
this young girl from the provinces. He denied that
this was so, and tried to make a laugh of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it credible, I ask you? Such an ugly creature!"</p>

<p>However, he experienced an intense feeling of
gratified vanity. He recalled to mind the reunion from
which he had returned one night, some time before,
his heart filled with bitter humiliation, and he drew a
deep breath, for it seemed to him that he was now
in the environment that really suited him, as if all
these things, including the Dambreuse mansion, belonged
to himself. The ladies formed a semicircle
around him while they listened to what he was saying,
and in order to create an effect, he declared that
he was in favor of the re-establishment of divorce,
which he maintained should be easily procurable, so
as to enable people to quit one another and come
back to one another without any limit as often as
they liked. They uttered loud protests; a few of them
began to talk in whispers. Little exclamations every
now and then burst forth from the place where the
wall was overshadowed with aristolochia. One would
imagine that it was a mirthful cackling of hens; and
he developed his theory with that self-complacency
which is generated by the consciousness of success.
A man-servant brought into the arbour a tray laden
with ices. The gentlemen drew close together and
began to chat about the recent arrests.</p>

<p>Thereupon Frederick revenged himself on the
Vicomte by making him believe that he might be prosecuted
as a Legitimist. The other urged by way of
reply that he had not stirred outside his own room.
His adversary enumerated in a heap the possible mischances.
MM. Dambreuse and Gr&eacute;monville found the
discussion very amusing. Then they paid Frederick
compliments, while expressing regret at the same
time that he did not employ his abilities in the de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>fence
of order. They grasped his hand with the utmost
warmth; he might for the future count on them.
At last, just as everyone was leaving, the Vicomte
made a low bow to C&eacute;cile:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I have the honour of wishing you
a very good evening."</p>

<p>She replied coldly:</p>

<p>"Good evening." But she gave Martinon a parting
smile.</p>

<p>P&eacute;re Roque, in order to continue the conversation
between himself and Arnoux, offered to see him
home, "as well as Madame"&mdash;they were going the
same way. Louise and Frederick walked in front of
them. She had caught hold of his arm; and, when
she was some distance away from the others she said:</p>

<p>"Ah! at last! at last! I've had enough to bear all
the evening! How nasty those women were! What
haughty airs they had!"</p>

<p>He made an effort to defend them.</p>

<p>"First of all, you might certainly have spoken to
me the moment you came in, after being away a
whole year!"</p>

<p>"It was not a year," said Frederick, glad to be
able to give some sort of rejoinder on this point in
order to avoid the other questions.</p>

<p>"Be it so; the time appeared very long to me,
that's all. But, during this horrid dinner, one would
think you felt ashamed of me. Ah! I understand&mdash;I
don't possess what is needed in order to please as
they do."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," said Frederick.</p>

<p>"Really! Swear to me that you don't love anyone!"</p>

<p>He did swear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"You love nobody but me alone?"</p>

<p>"I assure you, I do not."</p>

<p>This assurance filled her with delight. She would
have liked to lose her way in the streets, so that they
might walk about together the whole night.</p>

<p>"I have been so much tormented down there!
Nothing was talked about but barricades. I imagined
I saw you falling on your back covered with blood!
Your mother was confined to her bed with rheumatism.
She knew nothing about what was happening.
I had to hold my tongue. I could stand it no longer,
so I took Catherine with me."</p>

<p>And she related to him all about her departure,
her journey, and the lie she told her father.</p>

<p>"He's bringing me back in two days. Come to-morrow
evening, as if you were merely paying a
casual visit, and take advantage of the opportunity to
ask for my hand in marriage."</p>

<p>Never had Frederick been further from the idea of
marriage. Besides, Mademoiselle Roque appeared to
him a rather absurd young person. How different
she was from a woman like Madame Dambreuse! A
very different future was in store for him. He had
found reason to-day to feel perfectly certain on that
point; and, therefore, this was not the time to involve
himself, from mere sentimental motives, in a step of
such momentous importance. It was necessary now
to be decisive&mdash;and then he had seen Madame Arnoux
once more. Nevertheless he was rather embarrassed
by Louise's candour.</p>

<p>He said in reply to her last words:</p>

<p>"Have you considered this matter?"</p>

<p>"How is that?" she exclaimed, frozen with astonishment
and indignation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>He said that to marry at such a time as this
would be a piece of folly.</p>

<p>"So you don't want to have me?"</p>

<p>"Nay, you don't understand me!"</p>

<p>And he plunged into a confused mass of verbiage
in order to impress upon her that he was kept back
by more serious considerations; that he had business
on hand which it would take a long time to dispose
of; that even his inheritance had been placed in
jeopardy (Louise cut all this explanation short with
one plain word); that, last of all, the present political
situation made the thing undesirable. So, then, the
most reasonable course was to wait patiently for some
time. Matters would, no doubt, right themselves&mdash;at
least, he hoped so; and, as he could think of no further
grounds to go upon just at that moment, he
pretended to have been suddenly reminded that he
should have been with Dussardier two hours ago.</p>

<p>Then, bowing to the others, he darted down the
Rue Hauteville, took a turn round the Gymnase, returned
to the boulevard, and quickly rushed up Rosanette's
four flights of stairs.</p>

<p>M. and Madame Arnoux left P&eacute;re Roque and his
daughter at the entrance of the Rue Saint-Denis.
Husband and wife returned home without exchanging
a word, as he was unable to continue chattering any
longer, feeling quite worn out. She even leaned
against his shoulder. He was the only man who had
displayed any honourable sentiments during the evening.
She entertained towards him feelings of the utmost
indulgence. Meanwhile, he cherished a certain
degree of spite against Frederick.</p>

<p>"Did you notice his face when a question was
asked about the portrait? When I told you that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was her lover, you did not wish to believe what I
said!"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I was wrong!"</p>

<p>Arnoux, gratified with his triumph, pressed the
matter even further.</p>

<p>"I'd even make a bet that when he left us, a little
while ago, he went to see her again. He's with
her at this moment, you may be sure! He's finishing
the evening with her!"</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux had pulled down her hat very
low.</p>

<p>"Why, you're shaking all over!"</p>

<p>"That's because I feel cold!" was her reply.</p>

<p>As soon as her father was asleep, Louise made her
way into Catherine's room, and, catching her by the
shoulders, shook her.</p>

<p>"Get up&mdash;quick! as quick as ever you can! and
go and fetch a cab for me!"</p>

<p>Catherine replied that there was not one to be had
at such an hour.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me yourself there, then?"</p>

<p>"Where, might I ask?"</p>

<p>"To Frederick's house!"</p>

<p>"Impossible! What do you want to go there for?"</p>

<p>It was in order to have a talk with him. She
could not wait. She must see him immediately.</p>

<p>"Just think of what you're about to do! To present
yourself this way at a house in the middle of
the night! Besides, he's asleep by this time!"</p>

<p>"I'll wake him up!"</p>

<p>"But this is not a proper thing for a young girl
to do!"</p>

<p>"I am not a young girl&mdash;I'm his wife! I love
him! Come&mdash;put on your shawl!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Catherine, standing at the side of the bed, was
trying to make up her mind how to act. She said
at last:</p>

<p>"No! I won't go!"</p>

<p>"Well, stay behind then! I'll go there by myself!"</p>

<p>Louise glided like an adder towards the staircase.
Catherine rushed after her, and came up with her on
the footpath outside the house. Her remonstrances
were fruitless; and she followed the girl, fastening
her undervest as she hurried along in the rear. The
walk appeared to her exceedingly tedious. She complained
that her legs were getting weak from age.</p>

<p>"I'll go on after you&mdash;faith, I haven't the same
thing to drive me on that you have!"</p>

<p>Then she grew softened.</p>

<p>"Poor soul! You haven't anyone now but your
Catau, don't you see?"</p>

<p>From time to time scruples took hold of her
mind.</p>

<p>"Ah, this is a nice thing you're making me do!
Suppose your father happened to wake and miss you!
Lord God, let us hope no misfortune will happen!"</p>

<p>In front of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s, a patrol of
National Guards stopped them.</p>

<p>Louise immediately explained that she was going
with her servant to look for a doctor in the Rue
Rumfort. The patrol allowed them to pass on.</p>

<p>At the corner of the Madeleine they came across a
second patrol, and, Louise having given the same explanation,
one of the National Guards asked in return:</p>

<p>"Is it for a nine months' ailment, ducky?"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it!" exclaimed the captain, "no blackguardisms
in the ranks! Pass on, ladies!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the captain's orders, they still kept
cracking jokes.</p>

<p>"I wish you much joy!"</p>

<p>"My respects to the doctor!"</p>

<p>"Mind the wolf!"</p>

<p>"They like laughing," Catherine remarked in a loud
tone. "That's the way it is to be young."</p>

<p>At length they reached Frederick's abode.</p>

<p>Louise gave the bell a vigorous pull, which she repeated
several times. The door opened a little, and,
in answer to her inquiry, the porter said:</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"But he must be in bed!"</p>

<p>"I tell you he's not. Why, for nearly three months
he has not slept at home!"</p>

<p>And the little pane of the lodge fell down sharply,
like the blade of a guillotine.</p>

<p>They remained in the darkness under the archway.</p>

<p>An angry voice cried out to them:</p>

<p>"Be off!"</p>

<p>The door was again opened; they went away.</p>

<p>Louise had to sit down on a boundary-stone; and
clasping her face with her hands, she wept copious
tears welling up from her full heart. The day was
breaking, and carts were making their way into the
city.</p>

<p>Catherine led her back home, holding her up, kissing
her, and offering her every sort of consolation
that she could extract from her own experience.
She need not give herself so much trouble about a
lover. If this one failed her, she could find others.</p>

<p><img src="images/i_chxvi.png" width="115" height="125" alt="W" title="" class="illodrop" style="margin-top: -3.5em" />hen Rosanette's enthusiasm for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Gardes Mobiles had calmed down,
she became more charming than
ever, and Frederick insensibly
glided into the habit of living
with her.</p>

<p>The best portion of the day was the morning on
the terrace. In a light cambric dress, and with her
stockingless feet thrust into slippers, she kept moving
about him&mdash;went and cleaned her canaries' cage,
gave her gold-fishes some water, and with a fire-shovel
did a little amateur gardening in the box filled
with clay, from which arose a trellis of nasturtiums,
giving an attractive look to the wall. Then, resting,
with their elbows on the balcony, they stood side by
side, gazing at the vehicles and the passers-by; and
they warmed themselves in the sunlight, and made
plans for spending the evening. He absented himself
only for two hours at most, and, after that, they
would go to some theatre, where they would get seats
in front of the stage; and Rosanette, with a large
bouquet of flowers in her hand, would listen to the
instruments, while Frederick, leaning close to her ear,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
would tell her comic or amatory stories. At other
times they took an open carriage to drive to the Bois
de Boulogne. They kept walking about slowly until
the middle of the night. At last they made their way
home through the Arc de Triomphe and the grand
avenue, inhaling the breeze, with the stars above their
heads, and with all the gas-lamps ranged in the
background of the perspective like a double string of
luminous pearls.</p>

<p>Frederick always waited for her when they were
going out together. She was a very long time fastening
the two ribbons of her bonnet; and she smiled
at herself in the mirror set in the wardrobe; then she
would draw her arm over his, and, making him look
at himself in the glass beside her:</p>

<p>"We produce a good effect in this way, the two
of us side by side. Ah! my poor darling, I could eat
you!"</p>

<p>He was now her chattel, her property. She wore
on her face a continuous radiance, while at the same
time she appeared more languishing in manner, more
rounded in figure; and, without being able to explain
in what way, he found her altered, nevertheless.</p>

<p>One day she informed him, as if it were a very
important bit of news, that my lord Arnoux had
lately set up a linen-draper's shop for a woman who
was formerly employed in his pottery-works. He
used to go there every evening&mdash;"he spent a great
deal on it no later than a week ago; he had even
given her a set of rosewood furniture."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" said Frederick.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>Delphine, while carrying out some orders for her,
had made enquiries about the matter, She must, then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
be much attached to Arnoux to take such a deep
interest in his movements. He contented himself
with saying to her in reply:</p>

<p>"What does this signify to you?"</p>

<p>Rosanette looked surprised at this question.</p>

<p>"Why, the rascal owes me money. Isn't it atrocious
to see him keeping beggars?"</p>

<p>Then, with an expression of triumphant hate in
her face:</p>

<p>"Besides, she is having a nice laugh at him. She
has three others on hand. So much the better; and
I'll be glad if she eats him up, even to the last farthing!"</p>

<p>Arnoux had, in fact, let himself be made use of by
the girl from Bordeaux with the indulgence which
characterises senile attachments. His manufactory
was no longer going on. The entire state of his
affairs was pitiable; so that, in order to set them
afloat again, he was at first projecting the establishment
of a <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i>, at which only patriotic pieces
would be sung. With a grant from the Minister,
this establishment would become at the same time a
focus for the purpose of propagandism and a source
of profit. Now that power had been directed into a
different channel, the thing was impossible.</p>

<p>His next idea was a big military hat-making
business. He lacked capital, however, to give it a
start.</p>

<p>He was not more fortunate in his domestic life.
Madame Arnoux was less agreeable in manner towards
him, sometimes even a little rude. Berthe
always took her father's part. This increased the discord,
and the house was becoming intolerable. He
often set forth in the morning, passed his day in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
making long excursions out of the city, in order
to divert his thoughts, then dined at a rustic tavern,
abandoning himself to his reflections.</p>

<p>The prolonged absence of Frederick disturbed his
habits. Then he presented himself one afternoon,
begged of him to come and see him as in former
days, and obtained from him a promise to do so.</p>

<p>Frederick did not feel sufficient courage within him
to go back to Madame Arnoux's house. It seemed to
him as if he had betrayed her. But this conduct was
very pusillanimous. There was no excuse for it.
There was only one way of ending the matter, and
so, one evening, he set out on his way.</p>

<p>As the rain was falling, he had just turned up the
Passage Jouffroy, when, under the light shed from
the shop-windows, a fat little man accosted him.
Frederick had no difficulty in recognising Compain,
that orator whose motion had excited so much laughter
at the club. He was leaning on the arm of an
individual whose head was muffled in a zouave's red
cap, with a very long upper lip, a complexion as
yellow as an orange, a tuft of beard under his jaw,
and big staring eyes listening with wonder.</p>

<p>Compain was, no doubt, proud of him, for he said:</p>

<p>"Let me introduce you to this jolly dog! He is
a bootmaker whom I include amongst my friends.
Come and let us take something!"</p>

<p>Frederick having thanked him, he immediately
thundered against Rateau's motion, which he described
as a man&oelig;uvre of the aristocrats. In order to
put an end to it, it would be necessary to begin '93
over again! Then he enquired about Regimbart
and some others, who were also well known, such
as Masselin, Sanson, Lecornu, Mar&eacute;chal, and a cer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>tain
Deslauriers, who had been implicated in the case
of the carbines lately intercepted at Troyes.</p>

<p>All this was new to Frederick. Compain knew
nothing more about the subject. He quitted the
young man with these words:</p>

<p>"You'll come soon, will you not? for you belong
to it."</p>

<p>"To what?"</p>

<p>"The calf's head!"</p>

<p>"What calf's head?"</p>

<p>"Ha, you rogue!" returned Compain, giving him
a tap on the stomach.</p>

<p>And the two terrorists plunged into a caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Frederick was no longer thinking
of Deslauriers. He was on the footpath of the
Rue de Paradis in front of a house; and he was staring
at the light which came from a lamp in the second
floor behind a curtain.</p>

<p>At length he ascended the stairs.</p>

<p>"Is Arnoux there?"</p>

<p>The chambermaid answered:</p>

<p>"No; but come in all the same."</p>

<p>And, abruptly opening a door:</p>

<p>"Madame, it is Monsieur Moreau!"</p>

<p>She arose, whiter than the collar round her neck.</p>

<p>"To what do I owe the honour&mdash;of a visit&mdash;so
unexpected?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. The pleasure of seeing old friends once
more."</p>

<p>And as he took a seat:</p>

<p>"How is the worthy Arnoux going on?"</p>

<p>"Very well. He has gone out."</p>

<p>"Ah, I understand! still following his old nightly
practices. A little distraction!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why not? After a day spent in making calculations,
the head needs a rest."</p>

<p>She even praised her husband as a hard-working
man. Frederick was irritated at hearing this eulogy;
and pointing towards a piece of black cloth with a
narrow blue braid which lay on her lap:</p>

<p>"What is it you are doing there?"</p>

<p>"A jacket which I am trimming for my daughter."</p>

<p>"Now that you remind me of it, I have not seen
her. Where is she, pray?"</p>

<p>"At a boarding-school," was Madame Arnoux's
reply.</p>

<p>Tears came into her eyes. She held them back,
while she rapidly plied her needle. To keep himself
in countenance, he took up a number of <i>L'Illustration</i>
which had been lying on the table close to where
she sat.</p>

<p>"These caricatures of Cham are very funny, are
they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then they relapsed into silence once more.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, a fierce gust of wind shook the
window-panes.</p>

<p>"What weather!" said Frederick.</p>

<p>"It was very good of you, indeed, to come here
in the midst of this dreadful rain."</p>

<p>"Oh! what do I care about that? I'm not like
those whom it prevents, no doubt, from going to keep
their appointments."</p>

<p>"What appointments?" she asked with an ingenuous
air.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>A shudder ran through her frame and she hung
down her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>He gently laid his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"I assure you that you have given me great pain."</p>

<p>She replied, with a sort of wail in her voice:</p>

<p>"But I was frightened about my child."</p>

<p>She told him about Eug&egrave;ne's illness, and all the
tortures which she had endured on that day.</p>

<p>"Thanks! thanks! I doubt you no longer. I love
you as much as ever."</p>

<p>"Ah! no; it is not true!"</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>She glanced at him coldly.</p>

<p>"You forget the other! the one you took with you
to the races! the woman whose portrait you have&mdash;your
mistress!"</p>

<p>"Well, yes!" exclaimed Frederick, "I don't deny
anything! I am a wretch! Just listen to me!"</p>

<p>If he had done this, it was through despair, as one
commits suicide. However, he had made her very
unhappy in order to avenge himself on her with his
own shame.</p>

<p>"What mental anguish! Do you not realise what
it means?"</p>

<p>Madame Arnoux turned away her beautiful face
while she held out her hand to him; and they closed
their eyes, absorbed in a kind of intoxication that was
like a sweet, ceaseless rocking. Then they stood face
to face, gazing at one another.</p>

<p>"Could you believe it possible that I no longer
loved you?"</p>

<p>She replied in a low voice, full of caressing tenderness:</p>

<p>"No! in spite of everything, I felt at the bottom
of my heart that it was impossible, and that one day
the obstacle between us two would disappear!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"So did I; and I was dying to see you again."</p>

<p>"I once passed close to you in the Palais-Royal!"</p>

<p>"Did you really?"</p>

<p>And he spoke to her of the happiness he experienced
at coming across her again at the Dambreuses'
house.</p>

<p>"But how I hated you that evening as I was leaving
the place!"</p>

<p>"Poor boy!"</p>

<p>"My life is so sad!"</p>

<p>"And mine, too! If it were only the vexations,
the anxieties, the humiliations, all that I endure as
wife and as mother, seeing that one must die, I
would not complain; the frightful part of it is my
solitude, without anyone."</p>

<p>"But you have me here with you!"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes!"</p>

<p>A sob of deep emotion made her bosom swell.
She spread out her arms, and they strained one
another, while their lips met in a long kiss.</p>

<p>A creaking sound on the floor not far from them
reached their ears. There was a woman standing
close to them; it was Rosanette. Madame Arnoux
had recognised her. Her eyes, opened to their widest,
scanned this woman, full of astonishment and indignation.
At length Rosanette said to her:</p>

<p>"I have come to see Monsieur Arnoux about a
matter of business."</p>

<p>"You see he is not here."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's true," returned the Mar&eacute;chale. "Your
nurse is right! A thousand apologies!"</p>

<p>And turning towards Frederick:</p>

<p>"So here you are&mdash;you?"</p>

<p>The familiar tone in which she addressed him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
in her own presence, too, made Madame Arnoux
flush as if she had received a slap right across the face.</p>

<p>"I tell you again, he is not here!"</p>

<p>Then the Mar&eacute;chale, who was looking this way
and that, said quietly:</p>

<p>"Let us go back together! I have a cab waiting
below."</p>

<p>He pretended not to hear.</p>

<p>"Come! let us go!"</p>

<p>"Ah! yes! this is a good opportunity! Go! go!"
said Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>They went off together, and she stooped over the
head of the stairs in order to see them once more,
and a laugh&mdash;piercing, heart-rending, reached them
from the place where she stood. Frederick pushed
Rosanette into the cab, sat down opposite her, and
during the entire drive did not utter a word.</p>

<p>The infamy, which it outraged him to see once
more flowing back on him, had been brought about
by himself alone. He experienced at the same time
the dishonour of a crushing humiliation and the regret
caused by the loss of his new-found happiness. Just
when, at last, he had it in his grasp, it had for ever
more become impossible, and that through the fault
of this girl of the town, this harlot. He would have
liked to strangle her. He was choking with rage.
When they had got into the house he flung his hat
on a piece of furniture and tore off his cravat.</p>

<p>"Ha! you have just done a nice thing&mdash;confess it!"</p>

<p>She planted herself boldly in front of him.</p>

<p>"Ah! well, what of that? Where's the harm?"</p>

<p>"What! You are playing the spy on me?"</p>

<p>"Is that my fault? Why do you go to amuse
yourself with virtuous women?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind! I don't wish you to insult them."</p>

<p>"How have I insulted them?"</p>

<p>He had no answer to make to this, and in a more
spiteful tone:</p>

<p>"But on the other occasion, at the Champ de
Mars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! you bore us to death with your old
women!"</p>

<p>"Wretch!"</p>

<p>He raised his fist.</p>

<p>"Don't kill me! I'm pregnant!"</p>

<p>Frederick staggered back.</p>

<p>"You are lying!"</p>

<p>"Why, just look at me!"</p>

<p>She seized a candlestick, and pointing at her face:</p>

<p>"Don't you recognise the fact there?"</p>

<p>Little yellow spots dotted her skin, which was
strangely swollen. Frederick did not deny the evidence.
He went to the window, and opened it, took
a few steps up and down the room, and then sank
into an armchair.</p>

<p>This event was a calamity which, in the first
place, put off their rupture, and, in the next place,
upset all his plans. The notion of being a father,
moreover, appeared to him grotesque, inadmissible.
But why? If, in place of the Mar&eacute;chale&mdash;&mdash;And
his reverie became so deep that he had a kind of
hallucination. He saw there, on the carpet, in front
of the chimney-piece, a little girl. She resembled
Madame Arnoux and himself a little&mdash;dark, and yet
fair, with two black eyes, very large eyebrows, and
a red ribbon in her curling hair. (Oh, how he would
have loved her!) And he seemed to hear her voice
saying: "Papa! papa!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Rosanette, who had just undressed herself, came
across to him, and noticing a tear in his eyelids,
kissed him gravely on the forehead.</p>

<p>He arose, saying:</p>

<p>"By Jove, we mustn't kill this little one!"</p>

<p>Then she talked a lot of nonsense. To be sure,
it would be a boy, and its name would be Frederick.
It would be necessary for her to begin making its
clothes; and, seeing her so happy, a feeling of pity
for her took possession of him. As he no longer
cherished any anger against her, he desired to know
the explanation of the step she had recently taken.
She said it was because Mademoiselle Vatnaz had
sent her that day a bill which had been protested for
some time past; and so she hastened to Arnoux to
get the money from him.</p>

<p>"I'd have given it to you!" said Frederick.</p>

<p>"It is a simpler course for me to get over there
what belongs to me, and to pay back to the other
one her thousand francs."</p>

<p>"Is this really all you owe her?"</p>

<p>She answered:</p>

<p>"Certainly!"</p>

<p>On the following day, at nine o'clock in the evening
(the hour specified by the doorkeeper), Frederick
repaired to Mademoiselle Vatnaz's residence.</p>

<p>In the anteroom, he jostled against the furniture,
which was heaped together. But the sound of voices
and of music guided him. He opened a door, and
tumbled into the middle of a rout. Standing up before
a piano, which a young lady in spectacles was
fingering, Delmar, as serious as a pontiff, was declaiming
a humanitarian poem on prostitution; and
his hollow voice rolled to the accompaniment of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
metallic chords. A row of women sat close to the
wall, attired, as a rule, in dark colours without neck-bands
or sleeves. Five or six men, all people of culture,
occupied seats here and there. In an armchair
was seated a former writer of fables, a mere wreck
now; and the pungent odour of the two lamps was
intermingled with the aroma of the chocolate which
filled a number of bowls placed on the card-table.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Vatnaz, with an Oriental shawl
thrown over her shoulders, sat at one side of the
chimney-piece. Dussardier sat facing her at the other
side. He seemed to feel himself in an embarrassing
position. Besides, he was rather intimidated by his
artistic surroundings. Had the Vatnaz, then, broken
off with Delmar? Perhaps not. However, she seemed
jealous of the worthy shopman; and Frederick, having
asked to let him exchange a word with her, she
made a sign to him to go with them into her own
apartment. When the thousand francs were paid
down before her, she asked, in addition, for interest.</p>

<p>"'Tisn't worth while," said Dussardier.</p>

<p>"Pray hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>This want of moral courage on the part of so
brave a man was agreeable to Frederick as a justification
of his own conduct. He took away the bill
with him, and never again referred to the scandal at
Madame Arnoux's house. But from that time forth
he saw clearly all the defects in the Mar&eacute;chale's character.</p>

<p>She possessed incurable bad taste, incomprehensible
laziness, the ignorance of a savage, so much so
that she regarded Doctor Derogis as a person of great
celebrity, and she felt proud of entertaining himself
and his wife, because they were "married people."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
She lectured with a pedantic air on the affairs of
daily life to Mademoiselle Irma, a poor little creature
endowed with a little voice, who had as a protector
a gentleman "very well off," an ex-clerk in the Custom-house,
who had a rare talent for card tricks.
Rosanette used to call him "My big Loulou." Frederick
could no longer endure the repetition of her
stupid words, such as "Some custard," "To Chaillot,"
"One could never know," etc.; and she persisted
in wiping off the dust in the morning from her
trinkets with a pair of old white gloves. He was
above all disgusted by her treatment of her servant,
whose wages were constantly in arrear, and who
even lent her money. On the days when they settled
their accounts, they used to wrangle like two fish-women;
and then, on becoming reconciled, used to
embrace each other. It was a relief to him when
Madame Dambreuse's evening parties began again.</p>

<p>There, at any rate, he found something to amuse
him. She was well versed in the intrigues of society,
the changes of ambassadors, the personal character
of dressmakers; and, if commonplaces escaped
her lips, they did so in such a becoming fashion,
that her language might be regarded as the expression
of respect for propriety or of polite irony. It
was worth while to watch the way in which, in the
midst of twenty persons chatting around her, she
would, without overlooking any of them, bring about
the answers she desired and avoid those that were
dangerous. Things of a very simple nature, when
related by her, assumed the aspect of confidences.
Her slightest smile gave rise to dreams; in short, her
charm, like the exquisite scent which she usually
carried about with her, was complex and indefinable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>While he was with her, Frederick experienced on
each occasion the pleasure of a new discovery, and,
nevertheless, he always found her equally serene the
next time they met, like the reflection of limpid waters.</p>

<p>But why was there such coldness in her manner
towards her niece? At times she even darted strange
looks at her.</p>

<p>As soon as the question of marriage was started,
she had urged as an objection to it, when discussing
the matter with M. Dambreuse, the state of "the
dear child's" health, and had at once taken her off
to the baths of Balaruc. On her return fresh pretexts
were raised by her&mdash;that the young man was
not in a good position, that this ardent passion did
not appear to be a very serious attachment, and that
no risk would be run by waiting. Martinon had replied,
when the suggestion was made to him, that
he would wait. His conduct was sublime. He lectured
Frederick. He did more. He enlightened him
as to the best means of pleasing Madame Dambreuse,
even giving him to understand that he had ascertained
from the niece the sentiments of her aunt.</p>

<p>As for M. Dambreuse, far from exhibiting jealousy,
he treated his young friend with the utmost attention,
consulted him about different things, and even showed
anxiety about his future, so that one day, when they
were talking about P&egrave;re Roque, he whispered with a
sly air:</p>

<p>"You have done well."</p>

<p>And C&eacute;cile, Miss John, the servants and the
porter, every one of them exercised a fascination over
him in this house. He came there every evening,
quitting Rosanette for that purpose. Her approaching
maternity rendered her graver in manner, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
even a little melancholy, as if she were tortured by
anxieties. To every question put to her she replied:</p>

<p>"You are mistaken; I am quite well."</p>

<p>She had, as a matter of fact, signed five notes in
her previous transactions, and not having the courage
to tell Frederick after the first had been paid, she
had gone back to the abode of Arnoux, who had
promised her, in writing, the third part of his profits
in the lighting of the towns of Languedoc by gas (a
marvellous undertaking!), while requesting her not to
make use of this letter at the meeting of shareholders.
The meeting was put off from week to week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Mar&eacute;chale wanted money. She
would have died sooner than ask Frederick for any.
She did not wish to get it from him; it would have
spoiled their love. He contributed a great deal to the
household expenses; but a little carriage, which he
hired by the month, and other sacrifices, which
were indispensable since he had begun to visit the
Dambreuses, prevented him from doing more for
his mistress. On two or three occasions, when he
came back to the house at a different hour from his
usual time, he fancied he could see men's backs disappearing
behind the door, and she often went out
without wishing to state where she was going.
Frederick did not attempt to enquire minutely into
these matters. One of these days he would make up
his mind as to his future course of action. He
dreamed of another life which would be more amusing
and more noble. It was the fact that he had such
an ideal before his mind that rendered him indulgent
towards the Dambreuse mansion.</p>

<p>It was an establishment in the neighbourhood of
the Rue de Poitiers. There he met the great M. A.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the illustrious B., the profound C., the eloquent
Z., the immense Y., the old terrors of the Left
Centre, the paladins of the Right, the burgraves of
the golden mean; the eternal good old men of the
comedy. He was astonished at their abominable style
of talking, their meannesses, their rancours, their dishonesty&mdash;all
these personages, after voting for the
Constitution, now striving to destroy it; and they got
into a state of great agitation, and launched forth
manifestoes, pamphlets, and biographies. Hussonnet's
biography of Fumichon was a masterpiece. Nonancourt
devoted himself to the work of propagandism
in the country districts; M. de Gr&eacute;monville worked
up the clergy; and Martinon brought together the
young men of the wealthy class. Each exerted himself
according to his resources, including Cisy himself.
With his thoughts now all day long absorbed in
matters of grave moment, he kept making excursions
here and there in a cab in the interests of the party.</p>

<p>M. Dambreuse, like a barometer, constantly gave
expression to its latest variation. Lamartine could
not be alluded to without eliciting from this gentleman
the quotation of a famous phrase of the man of
the people: "Enough of poetry!" Cavaignac was,
from this time forth, nothing better in his eyes than
a traitor. The President, whom he had admired for
a period of three months, was beginning to fall off
in his esteem (as he did not appear to exhibit the
"necessary energy"); and, as he always wanted a
savior, his gratitude, since the affair of the Conservatoire,
belonged to Changarnier: "Thank God for
Changarnier.... Let us place our reliance on
Changarnier.... Oh, there's nothing to fear as
long as Changarnier&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>M. Thiers was praised, above all, for his volume
against Socialism, in which he showed that he was
quite as much of a thinker as a writer. There was
an immense laugh at Pierre Leroux, who had quoted
passages from the philosophers in the Chamber.
Jokes were made about the phalansterian tail. The
"Market of Ideas" came in for a meed of applause,
and its authors were compared to Aristophanes.
Frederick patronised the work as well as the rest.</p>

<p>Political verbiage and good living had an enervating
effect on his morality. Mediocre in capacity as
these persons appeared to him, he felt proud of knowing
them, and internally longed for the respectability
that attached to a wealthy citizen. A mistress like
Madame Dambreuse would give him a position.</p>

<p>He set about taking the necessary steps for achieving
that object.</p>

<p>He made it his business to cross her path, did
not fail to go and greet her with a bow in her box
at the theatre, and, being aware of the hours when
she went to church, he would plant himself behind a
pillar in a melancholy attitude. There was a continual
interchange of little notes between them with regard
to curiosities to which they drew each other's
attention, preparations for a concert, or the borrowing
of books or reviews. In addition to his visit each
night, he sometimes made a call just as the day was
closing; and he experienced a progressive succession
of pleasures in passing through the large front entrance,
through the courtyard, through the anteroom,
and through the two reception-rooms. Finally, he
reached her boudoir, which was as quiet as a tomb,
as warm as an alcove, and in which one jostled
against the upholstered edging of furniture in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
midst of objects of every sort placed here and there&mdash;chiffoniers,
screens, bowls, and trays made of lacquer,
or shell, or ivory, or malachite, expensive
trifles, to which fresh additions were frequently made.
Amongst single specimens of these rarities might be
noticed three Etretat rollers which were used as
paper-presses, and a Frisian cap hung from a Chinese
folding-screen. Nevertheless, there was a harmony
between all these things, and one was even impressed
by the noble aspect of the entire place, which was,
no doubt, due to the loftiness of the ceiling, the richness
of the porti&egrave;res, and the long silk fringes that
floated over the gold legs of the stools.</p>

<p>She nearly always sat on a little sofa, close to the
flower-stand, which garnished the recess of the window.
Frederick, seating himself on the edge of a
large wheeled ottoman, addressed to her compliments
of the most appropriate kind that he could conceive;
and she looked at him, with her head a little on one
side, and a smile playing round her mouth.</p>

<p>He read for her pieces of poetry, into which he
threw his whole soul in order to move her and excite
her admiration. She would now and then interrupt
him with a disparaging remark or a practical
observation; and their conversation relapsed incessantly
into the eternal question of Love. They discussed
with each other what were the circumstances
that produced it, whether women felt it more than
men, and what was the difference between them on
that point. Frederick tried to express his opinion,
and, at the same time, to avoid anything like coarseness
or insipidity. This became at length a species
of contest between them, sometimes agreeable and at
other times tedious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst at her side, he did not experience that
ravishment of his entire being which drew him towards
Madame Arnoux, nor the feeling of voluptuous
delight with which Rosanette had, at first, inspired
him. But he felt a passion for her as a thing that
was abnormal and difficult of attainment, because she
was of aristocratic rank, because she was wealthy,
because she was a devotee&mdash;imagining that she had
a delicacy of sentiment as rare as the lace she wore, together
with amulets on her skin, and modest instincts
even in her depravity.</p>

<p>He made a certain use of his old passion for Madame
Arnoux, uttering in his new flame's hearing all
those amorous sentiments which the other had caused
him to feel in downright earnest, and pretending that
it was Madame Dambreuse herself who had occasioned
them. She received these avowals like one accustomed
to such things, and, without giving him a
formal repulse, did not yield in the slightest degree;
and he came no nearer to seducing her than Martinon
did to getting married. In order to bring matters to
an end with her niece's suitor, she accused him of
having money for his object, and even begged of her
husband to put the matter to the test. M. Dambreuse
then declared to the young man that C&eacute;cile, being
the orphan child of poor parents, had neither expectations
nor a dowry.</p>

<p>Martinon, not believing that this was true, or feeling
that he had gone too far to draw back, or
through one of those outbursts of idiotic infatuation
which may be described as acts of genius, replied
that his patrimony, amounting to fifteen thousand
francs a year, would be sufficient for them. The
banker was touched by this unexpected display of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
disinterestedness. He promised the young man a tax-collectorship,
undertaking to obtain the post for him;
and in the month of May, 1850, Martinon married
Mademoiselle C&eacute;cile. There was no ball to celebrate
the event. The young people started the same evening
for Italy. Frederick came next day to pay a
visit to Madame Dambreuse. She appeared to him
paler than usual. She sharply contradicted him about
two or three matters of no importance. However,
she went on to observe, all men were egoists.</p>

<p>There were, however, some devoted men, though
he might happen himself to be the only one.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! you're just like the rest of them!"</p>

<p>Her eyelids were red; she had been weeping.</p>

<p>Then, forcing a smile:</p>

<p>"Pardon me; I am in the wrong. Sad thoughts
have taken possession of my mind."</p>

<p>He could not understand what she meant to convey
by the last words.</p>

<p>"No matter! she is not so hard to overcome as I
imagined," he thought.</p>

<p>She rang for a glass of water, drank a mouthful
of it, sent it away again, and then began to complain
of the wretched way in which her servants attended
on her. In order to amuse her, he offered to become
her servant himself, pretending that he knew
how to hand round plates, dust furniture, and announce
visitors&mdash;in fact, to do the duties of a <i>valet-de-chambre</i>,
or, rather, of a running-footman, although
the latter was now out of fashion. He would have
liked to cling on behind her carriage with a hat
adorned with cock's feathers.</p>

<p>"And how I would follow you with majestic
stride, carrying your pug on my arm!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are facetious," said Madame Dambreuse.</p>

<p>Was it not a piece of folly, he returned, to take
everything seriously? There were enough of miseries
in the world without creating fresh ones. Nothing
was worth the cost of a single pang. Madame Dambreuse
raised her eyelids with a sort of vague approval.</p>

<p>This agreement in their views of life impelled
Frederick to take a bolder course. His former miscalculations
now gave him insight. He went on:</p>

<p>"Our grandsires lived better. Why not obey the
impulse that urges us onward?" After all, love was
not a thing of such importance in itself.</p>

<p>"But what you have just said is immoral!"</p>

<p>She had resumed her seat on the little sofa. He
sat down at the side of it, near her feet.</p>

<p>"Don't you see that I am lying! For in order to
please women, one must exhibit the thoughtlessness
of a buffoon or all the wild passion of tragedy!
They only laugh at us when we simply tell them
that we love them! For my part, I consider those
hyperbolical phrases which tickle their fancy a profanation
of true love, so that it is no longer possible
to give expression to it, especially when addressing
women who possess more than ordinary intelligence."</p>

<p>She gazed at him from under her drooping eyelids.
He lowered his voice, while he bent his head
closer to her face.</p>

<p>"Yes! you frighten me! Perhaps I am offending
you? Forgive me! I did not intend to say all that I
have said! 'Tis not my fault! You are so beautiful!"</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse closed her eyes, and he was
astonished at his easy victory. The tall trees in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
clouds streaked the sky with long strips of red, and
on every side there seemed to be a suspension of
vital movements. Then he recalled to mind, in a
confused sort of way, evenings just the same as this,
filled with the same unbroken silence. Where was it
that he had known them?</p>

<p>He sank upon his knees, seized her hand, and
swore that he would love her for ever. Then, as he
was leaving her, she beckoned to him to come back,
and said to him in a low tone:</p>

<p>"Come by-and-by and dine with us! We'll be
all alone!"</p>

<p>It seemed to Frederick, as he descended the
stairs, that he had become a different man, that he
was surrounded by the balmy temperature of hot-houses,
and that he was beyond all question entering
into the higher sphere of patrician adulteries and lofty
intrigues. In order to occupy the first rank there all
he required was a woman of this stamp. Greedy, no
doubt, of power and of success, and married to a
man of inferior calibre, for whom she had done prodigious
services, she longed for some one of ability
in order to be his guide. Nothing was impossible
now. He felt himself capable of riding two hundred
leagues on horseback, of travelling for several nights
in succession without fatigue. His heart overflowed
with pride.</p>

<p>Just in front of him, on the footpath, a man
wrapped in a seedy overcoat was walking, with
downcast eyes, and with such an air of dejection
that Frederick, as he passed, turned aside to have
a better look at him. The other raised his head. It
was Deslauriers. He hesitated. Frederick fell upon
his neck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! my poor old friend! What! 'tis you!"</p>

<p>And he dragged Deslauriers into his house, at the
same time asking his friend a heap of questions.</p>

<p>Ledru-Rollin's ex-commissioner commenced by
describing the tortures to which he had been subjected.
As he preached fraternity to the Conservatives,
and respect for the laws to the Socialists, the
former tried to shoot him, and the latter brought
cords to hang him with. After June he had been
brutally dismissed. He found himself involved in a
charge of conspiracy&mdash;that which was connected with
the seizure of arms at Troyes. He had subsequently
been released for want of evidence to sustain the
charge. Then the acting committee had sent him to
London, where his ears had been boxed in the very
middle of a banquet at which he and his colleagues
were being entertained. On his return to Paris&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why did you not call here, then, to see me?"</p>

<p>"You were always out! Your porter had mysterious
airs&mdash;I did not know what to think; and, in
the next place, I had no desire to reappear before
you in the character of a defeated man."</p>

<p>He had knocked at the portals of Democracy, offering
to serve it with his pen, with his tongue, with
all his energies. He had been everywhere repelled.
They had mistrusted him; and he had sold his watch,
his bookcase, and even his linen.</p>

<p>"It would be much better to be breaking one's
back on the pontoons of Belle Isle with S&eacute;n&eacute;cal!"</p>

<p>Frederick, who had been fastening his cravat, did
not appear to be much affected by this news.</p>

<p>"Ha! so he is transported, this good S&eacute;n&eacute;cal?"</p>

<p>Deslauriers replied, while he surveyed the walls
with an envious air:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not everybody has your luck!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Frederick, without noticing
the allusion to his own circumstances, "but I am
dining in the city. We must get you something to
eat; order whatever you like. Take even my bed!"</p>

<p>This cordial reception dissipated Deslauriers' bitterness.</p>

<p>"Your bed? But that might inconvenience you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I have others!"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right!" returned the advocate, with a
laugh. "Pray, where are you dining?"</p>

<p>"At Madame Dambreuse's."</p>

<p>"Can it be that you are&mdash;perhaps&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"You are too inquisitive," said Frederick, with a
smile, which confirmed this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Then, after a glance at the clock, he resumed his
seat.</p>

<p>"That's how it is! and we mustn't despair, my
ex-defender of the people!"</p>

<p>"Oh, pardon me; let others bother themselves
about the people henceforth!"</p>

<p>The advocate detested the working-men, because
he had suffered so much on their account in his
province, a coal-mining district. Every pit had appointed
a provisional government, from which he received
orders.</p>

<p>"Besides, their conduct has been everywhere
charming&mdash;at Lyons, at Lille, at Havre, at Paris!
For, in imitation of the manufacturers, who would
fain exclude the products of the foreigner, these gentlemen
call on us to banish the English, German,
Belgian, and Savoyard workmen. As for their intelligence,
what was the use of that precious trades'
union of theirs which they established under the Res<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>toration?
In 1830 they joined the National Guard,
without having the common sense to get the upper
hand of it. Is it not the fact that, since the morning
when 1848 dawned, the various trade-bodies had not
reappeared with their banners? They have even demanded
popular representatives for themselves, who
are not to open their lips except on their own behalf.
All this is the same as if the deputies who represent
beetroot were to concern themselves about nothing
save beetroot. Ah! I've had enough of these dodgers
who in turn prostrate themselves before the scaffold
of Robespierre, the boots of the Emperor, and the
umbrella of Louis Philippe&mdash;a rabble who always
yield allegiance to the person that flings bread into
their mouths. They are always crying out against
the venality of Talleyrand and Mirabeau; but the messenger
down below there would sell his country for
fifty centimes if they'd only promise to fix a tariff of
three francs on his walk. Ah! what a wretched state
of affairs! We ought to set the four corners of
Europe on fire!"</p>

<p>Frederick said in reply:</p>

<p>"The spark is what you lack! You were simply
a lot of shopboys, and even the best of you were
nothing better than penniless students. As for the
workmen, they may well complain; for, if you except
a million taken out of the civil list, and of
which you made a grant to them with the meanest
expressions of flattery, you have done nothing for
them, save to talk in stilted phrases! The workman's
certificate remains in the hands of the employer, and
the person who is paid wages remains (even in the
eye of the law), the inferior of his master, because
his word is not believed. In short, the Republic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
seems to me a worn-out institution. Who knows?
Perhaps Progress can be realised only through an
aristocracy or through a single man? The initiative
always comes from the top, and whatever may be
the people's pretensions, they are lower than those
placed over them!"</p>

<p>"That may be true," said Deslauriers.</p>

<p>According to Frederick, the vast majority of citizens
aimed only at a life of peace (he had been improved
by his visits to the Dambreuses), and the
chances were all on the side of the Conservatives.
That party, however, was lacking in new men.</p>

<p>"If you came forward, I am sure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence. Deslauriers saw
what Frederick meant, and passed his two hands
over his head; then, all of a sudden:</p>

<p>"But what about yourself? Is there anything to
prevent you from doing it? Why would you not be
a deputy?"</p>

<p>In consequence of a double election there was in
the Aube a vacancy for a candidate. M. Dambreuse,
who had been re-elected as a member of the Legislative
Assembly, belonged to a different arrondissement.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to interest myself on your behalf?"
He was acquainted with many publicans,
schoolmasters, doctors, notaries' clerks and their masters.
"Besides, you can make the peasants believe
anything you like!"</p>

<p>Frederick felt his ambition rekindling.</p>

<p>Deslauriers added:</p>

<p>"You would find no trouble in getting a situation
for me in Paris."</p>

<p>"Oh! it would not be hard to manage it through
Monsieur Dambreuse."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"As we happened to have been talking just now
about coal-mines," the advocate went on, "what has
become of his big company? This is the sort of employment
that would suit me, and I could make myself
useful to them while preserving my own
independence."</p>

<p>Frederick promised that he would introduce him
to the banker before three days had passed.</p>

<p>The dinner, which he enjoyed alone with Madame
Dambreuse, was a delightful affair. She sat facing
him with a smile on her countenance at the opposite
side of the table, whereon was placed a basket of
flowers, while a lamp suspended above their heads
shed its light on the scene; and, as the window was
open, they could see the stars. They talked very
little, distrusting themselves, no doubt; but, the moment
the servants had turned their backs, they sent
across a kiss to one another from the tips of their
lips. He told her about his idea of becoming a candidate.
She approved of the project, promising even
to get M. Dambreuse to use every effort on his behalf.</p>

<p>As the evening advanced, some of her friends presented
themselves for the purpose of congratulating
her, and, at the same time, expressing sympathy with
her; she must be so much pained at the loss of her
niece. Besides, it was all very well for newly-married
people to go on a trip; by-and-by would come
incumbrances, children. But really, Italy did not realise
one's expectations. They had not as yet passed
the age of illusions; and, in the next place, the
honeymoon made everything look beautiful. The last
two who remained behind were M. de Gr&eacute;monville
and Frederick. The diplomatist was not inclined to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
leave. At last he departed at midnight. Madame
Dambreuse beckoned to Frederick to go with him,
and thanked him for this compliance with her wishes
by giving him a gentle pressure with her hand more
delightful than anything that had gone before.</p>

<p>The Mar&eacute;chale uttered an exclamation of joy on
seeing him again. She had been waiting for him for
the last five hours. He gave as an excuse for the
delay an indispensable step which he had to take in
the interests of Deslauriers. His face wore a look of
triumph, and was surrounded by an aureola which
dazzled Rosanette.</p>

<p>"'Tis perhaps on account of your black coat,
which fits you well; but I have never seen you look
so handsome! How handsome you are!"</p>

<p>In a transport of tenderness, she made a vow internally
never again to belong to any other man, no
matter what might be the consequence, even if she
were to die of want.</p>

<p>Her pretty eyes sparkled with such intense passion
that Frederick took her upon his knees and said
to himself:</p>

<p>"What a rascally part I am playing!" while admiring
his own perversity.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter"><a name="chapter_xvii" id="chapter_xvii"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">A Strange Betrothal.</h3>



<p><img src="images/i_chxvii.png" width="118" height="125" alt="M" title="" class="illodrop" style="margin-top: -3.5em" /> Dambreuse, when Deslauriers presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
himself at his house, was
thinking of reviving his great coal-mining
speculation. But this fusion
of all the companies into one was
looked upon unfavourably; there was
an outcry against monopolies, as if immense capital
were not needed for carrying out enterprises of this
kind!</p>

<p>Deslauriers, who had read for the purpose the
work of Gobet and the articles of M. Chappe in the
<i>Journal des Mines</i>, understood the question perfectly.
He demonstrated that the law of 1810 established for
the benefit of the grantee a privilege which could
not be transferred. Besides, a democratic colour
might be given to the undertaking. To interfere
with the formation of coal-mining companies was
against the principle even of association.</p>

<p>M. Dambreuse intrusted to him some notes for
the purpose of drawing up a memorandum. As for
the way in which he meant to pay for the work, he
was all the more profuse in his promises from the
fact that they were not very definite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Deslauriers called again at Frederick's house, and
gave him an account of the interview. Moreover, he
had caught a glimpse of Madame Dambreuse at the
bottom of the stairs, just as he was going out.</p>

<p>"I wish you joy&mdash;upon my soul, I do!"</p>

<p>Then they had a chat about the election. There
was something to be devised in order to carry it.</p>

<p>Three days later Deslauriers reappeared with a
sheet of paper covered with handwriting, intended
for the newspapers, and which was nothing less than
a friendly letter from M. Dambreuse, expressing approval
of their friend's candidature. Supported by a
Conservative and praised by a Red, he ought to succeed.
How was it that the capitalist had put his
signature to such a lucubration? The advocate had,
of his own motion, and without the least appearance
of embarrassment, gone and shown it to Madame
Dambreuse, who, thinking it quite appropriate, had
taken the rest of the business on her own shoulders.</p>

<p>Frederick was astonished at this proceeding.
Nevertheless, he approved of it; then, as Deslauriers
was to have an interview with M. Roque, his friend
explained to him how he stood with regard to
Louise.</p>

<p>"Tell them anything you like; that my affairs are
in an unsettled state, that I am putting them in order.
She is young enough to wait!"</p>

<p>Deslauriers set forth, and Frederick looked upon
himself as a very able man. He experienced, moreover,
a feeling of gratification, a profound satisfaction.
His delight at being the possessor of a rich
woman was not spoiled by any contrast. The sentiment
harmonised with the surroundings. His life
now would be full of joy in every sense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most delicious sensation of all was
to gaze at Madame Dambreuse in the midst of a
number of other ladies in her drawing-room. The
propriety of her manners made him dream of other
attitudes. While she was talking in a tone of coldness,
he would recall to mind the loving words
which she had murmured in his ear. All the respect
which he felt for her virtue gave him a thrill of
pleasure, as if it were a homage which was reflected
back on himself; and at times he felt a longing to
exclaim:</p>

<p>"But I know her better than you! She is mine!"</p>

<p>It was not long ere their relations came to be
socially recognised as an established fact. Madame
Dambreuse, during the whole winter, brought Frederick
with her into fashionable society.</p>

<p>He nearly always arrived before her; and he
watched her as she entered the house they were
visiting with her arms uncovered, a fan in her
hand, and pearls in her hair. She would pause on
the threshold (the lintel of the door formed a framework
round her head), and she would open and
shut her eyes with a certain air of indecision, in order
to see whether he was there.</p>

<p>She drove him back in her carriage; the rain
lashed the carriage-blinds. The passers-by seemed
merely shadows wavering in the mire of the street;
and, pressed close to each other, they observed all
these things vaguely with a calm disdain. Under
various pretexts, he would linger in her room for an
entire additional hour.</p>

<p>It was chiefly through a feeling of ennui that
Madame Dambreuse had yielded. But this latest experience
was not to be wasted. She desired to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
herself up to an absorbing passion; and so she began
to heap on his head adulations and caresses.</p>

<p>She sent him flowers; she had an upholstered
chair made for him. She made presents to him of a
cigar-holder, an inkstand, a thousand little things for
daily use, so that every act of his life should recall
her to his memory. These kind attentions charmed
him at first, and in a little while appeared to him
very simple.</p>

<p>She would step into a cab, get rid of it at the
opening into a by-way, and come out at the other
end; and then, gliding along by the walls, with a
double veil on her face, she would reach the street
where Frederick, who had been keeping watch, would
take her arm quickly to lead her towards his house.
His two men-servants would have gone out for a
walk, and the doorkeeper would have been sent on
some errand. She would throw a glance around her&mdash;nothing
to fear!&mdash;and she would breathe forth the
sigh of an exile who beholds his country once more.
Their good fortune emboldened them. Their appointments
became more frequent. One evening, she even
presented herself, all of a sudden, in full ball-dress.
These surprises might have perilous consequences.
He reproached her for her lack of prudence. Nevertheless,
he was not taken with her appearance. The
low body of her dress exposed her thinness too
freely.</p>

<p>It was then that he discovered what had hitherto
been hidden from him&mdash;the disillusion of his senses.
None the less did he make professions of ardent love;
but in order to call up such emotions he found it
necessary to evoke the images of Rosanette and Madame
Arnoux.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>This sentimental atrophy left his intellect entirely
untrammelled; and he was more ambitious than ever
of attaining a high position in society. Inasmuch as
he had such a stepping-stone, the very least he could
do was to make use of it.</p>

<p>One morning, about the middle of January, S&eacute;n&eacute;cal
entered his study, and in response to his exclamation
of astonishment, announced that he was
Deslauriers' secretary. He even brought Frederick a
letter. It contained good news, and yet it took him
to task for his negligence; he would have to come
down to the scene of action at once. The future
deputy said he would set out on his way there in
two days' time.</p>

<p>S&eacute;n&eacute;cal gave no opinion on the other's merits as a
candidate. He spoke about his own concerns and
about the affairs of the country.</p>

<p>Miserable as the state of things happened to be,
it gave him pleasure, for they were advancing in the
direction of Communism. In the first place, the Administration
led towards it of its own accord, since
every day a greater number of things were controlled
by the Government. As for Property, the Constitution
of '48, in spite of its weaknesses, had not spared
it. The State might, in the name of public utility,
henceforth take whatever it thought would suit it.
S&eacute;n&eacute;cal declared himself in favour of authority; and
Frederick noticed in his remarks the exaggeration
which characterised what he had said himself to Deslauriers.
The Republican even inveighed against the
masses for their inadequacy.</p>

<p>"Robespierre, by upholding the right of the
minority, had brought Louis XVI. to acknowledge
the National Convention, and saved the people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Things were rendered legitimate by the end towards
which they were directed. A dictatorship is sometimes
indispensable. Long live tyranny, provided
that the tyrant promotes the public welfare!"</p>

<p>Their discussion lasted a long time; and, as he
was taking his departure, S&eacute;n&eacute;cal confessed (perhaps
it was the real object of his visit) that Deslauriers
was getting very impatient at M. Dambreuse's silence.</p>

<p>But M. Dambreuse was ill. Frederick saw him
every day, his character of an intimate friend enabling
him to obtain admission to the invalid's bedside.</p>

<p>General Changarnier's recall had powerfully affected
the capitalist's mind. He was, on the evening of the
occurrence, seized with a burning sensation in his
chest, together with an oppression that prevented
him from lying down. The application of leeches
gave him immediate relief. The dry cough disappeared;
the respiration became more easy; and, eight
days later, he said, while swallowing some broth:</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm better now&mdash;but I was near going on
the last long journey!"</p>

<p>"Not without me!" exclaimed Madame Dambreuse,
intending by this remark to convey that she would
not be able to outlive him.</p>

<p>Instead of replying, he cast upon her and upon
her lover a singular smile, in which there was at the
same time resignation, indulgence, irony, and even,
as it were, a touch of humour, a sort of secret satisfaction
almost amounting to actual joy.</p>

<p>Frederick wished to start for Nogent. Madame
Dambreuse objected to this; and he unpacked and re-packed
his luggage by turns according to the changes
in the invalid's condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly M. Dambreuse spat forth considerable
blood. The "princes of medical science," on being
consulted, could not think of any fresh remedy. His
legs swelled, and his weakness increased. He had
several times evinced a desire to see C&eacute;cile, who was
at the other end of France with her husband, now a
collector of taxes, a position to which he had been
appointed a month ago. M. Dambreuse gave express
orders to send for her. Madame Dambreuse wrote
three letters, which she showed him.</p>

<p>Without trusting him even to the care of the nun,
she did not leave him for one second, and no longer
went to bed. The ladies who had their names entered
at the door-lodge made enquiries about her
with feelings of admiration, and the passers-by were
filled with respect on seeing the quantity of straw
which was placed in the street under the windows.</p>

<p>On the 12th of February, at five o'clock, a frightful
h&aelig;moptysis came on. The doctor who had charge
of him pointed out that the case had assumed a dangerous
aspect. They sent in hot haste for a priest.</p>

<p>While M. Dambreuse was making his confession,
Madame kept gazing curiously at him some distance
away. After this, the young doctor applied a blister,
and awaited the result.</p>

<p>The flame of the lamps, obscured by some of the
furniture, lighted up the apartment in an irregular
fashion. Frederick and Madame Dambreuse, at the
foot of the bed, watched the dying man. In the
recess of a window the priest and the doctor chatted
in low tones. The good sister on her knees kept
mumbling prayers.</p>

<p>At last came a rattling in the throat. The hands
grew cold; the face began to turn white. Now and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
then he drew a deep breath all of a sudden; but
gradually this became rarer and rarer. Two or three
confused words escaped him. He turned his eyes
upward, and at the same moment his respiration became
so feeble that it was almost imperceptible.
Then his head sank on one side on the pillow.</p>

<p>For a minute, all present remained motionless.</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse advanced towards the dead
body of her husband, and, without an effort&mdash;with
the unaffectedness of one discharging a duty&mdash;she
drew down the eyelids. Then she spread out her
two arms, her figure writhing as if in a spasm of repressed
despair, and quitted the room, supported by
the physician and the nun.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour afterwards, Frederick made
his way up to her apartment.</p>

<p>There was in it an indefinable odour, emanating
from some delicate substances with which it was
filled. In the middle of the bed lay a black dress,
which formed a glaring contrast with the pink coverlet.</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse was standing at the corner of
the mantelpiece. Without attributing to her any passionate
regret, he thought she looked a little sad;
and, in a mournful voice, he said:</p>

<p>"You are enduring pain?"</p>

<p>"I? No&mdash;not at all."</p>

<p>As she turned around, her eyes fell on the dress,
which she inspected. Then she told him not to
stand on ceremony.</p>

<p>"Smoke, if you like! You can make yourself at
home with me!"</p>

<p>And, with a great sigh:</p>

<p>"Ah! Blessed Virgin!&mdash;what a riddance!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick was astonished at this exclamation. He
replied, as he kissed her hand:</p>

<p>"All the same, you were free!"</p>

<p>This allusion to the facility with which the intrigue
between them had been carried on hurt Madame
Dambreuse.</p>

<p>"Ah! you don't know the services that I did for
him, or the misery in which I lived!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly! Was it a safe thing to have
always near him that bastard, a daughter, whom he
introduced into the house at the end of five years of
married life, and who, were it not for me, might
have led him into some act of folly?"</p>

<p>Then she explained how her affairs stood. The
arrangement on the occasion of her marriage was
that the property of each party should be separate.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
The amount of her inheritance was three hundred
thousand francs. M. Dambreuse had guaranteed by
the marriage contract that in the event of her surviving
him, she should have an income of fifteen thousand
francs a year, together with the ownership of
the mansion. But a short time afterwards he had
made a will by which he gave her all he possessed,
and this she estimated, so far as it was possible to
ascertain just at present, at over three millions.</p>

<p>Frederick opened his eyes widely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was worth the trouble, wasn't it? However,
I contributed to it! It was my own property I was
protecting; C&eacute;cile would have unjustly robbed me
of it."</p>

<p>"Why did she not come to see her father?"</p>

<p>As he asked her this question Madame Dambreuse
eyed him attentively; then, in a dry tone:</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea! Want of heart, probably!
Oh! I know what she is! And for that reason
she won't get a farthing from me!"</p>

<p>She had not been very troublesome, he pointed
out; at any rate, since her marriage.</p>

<p>"Ha! her marriage!" said Madame Dambreuse,
with a sneer. And she grudged having treated only
too well this stupid creature, who was jealous, self-interested,
and hypocritical. "All the faults of her
father!" She disparaged him more and more. There
was never a person with such profound duplicity,
and with such a merciless disposition into the bargain,
as hard as a stone&mdash;"a bad man, a bad man!"</p>

<p>Even the wisest people fall into errors. Madame
Dambreuse had just made a serious one through this
overflow of hatred on her part. Frederick, sitting
opposite her in an easy chair, was reflecting deeply,
scandalised by the language she had used.</p>

<p>She arose and knelt down beside him.</p>

<p>"To be with you is the only real pleasure! You
are the only one I love!"</p>

<p>While she gazed at him her heart softened, a nervous
reaction brought tears into her eyes, and she
murmured:</p>

<p>"Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>At first he thought he had not understood what
she meant. He was stunned by this wealth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>She repeated in a louder tone:</p>

<p>"Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>At last he said with a smile:</p>

<p>"Have you any doubt about it?"</p>

<p>Then the thought forced itself on his mind that his
conduct was infamous, and in order to make a kind
of reparation to the dead man, he offered to watch by
his side himself. But, feeling ashamed of this pious
sentiment, he added, in a flippant tone:</p>

<p>"It would be perhaps more seemly."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, indeed," she said, "on account of
the servants."</p>

<p>The bed had been drawn completely out of the alcove.
The nun was near the foot of it, and at the
head of it sat a priest, a different one, a tall, spare
man, with the look of a fanatical Spaniard. On the
night-table, covered with a white cloth, three wax-tapers
were burning.</p>

<p>Frederick took a chair, and gazed at the corpse.</p>

<p>The face was as yellow as straw. At the corners
of the mouth there were traces of blood-stained foam.
A silk handkerchief was tied around the skull, and
on the breast, covered with a knitted waistcoat, lay a
silver crucifix between the two crossed hands.</p>

<p>It was over, this life full of anxieties! How many
journeys had he not made to various places? How
many rows of figures had he not piled together?
How many speculations had he not hatched? How
many reports had he not heard read? What quackeries,
what smiles and curvets! For he had acclaimed
Napol&eacute;on, the Cossacks, Louis XVIII., 1830, the working-men,
every <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, loving power so dearly that
he would have paid in order to have the opportunity
of selling himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>But he had left behind him the estate of La Fortelle,
three factories in Picardy, the woods of Cranc&eacute;
in the Yonne, a farm near Orl&eacute;ans, and a great deal
of personal property in the form of bills and papers.</p>

<p>Frederick thus made an estimate of her fortune;
and it would soon, nevertheless, belong to him! First
of all, he thought of "what people would say"; then
he asked himself what present he ought to make to
his mother, and he was concerned about his future
equipages, and about employing an old coachman belonging
to his own family as the doorkeeper. Of
course, the livery would not be the same. He would
convert the large reception-room into his own study.
There was nothing to prevent him by knocking down
three walls from setting up a picture-gallery on the
second-floor. Perhaps there might be an opportunity
for introducing into the lower portion of the house a
hall for Turkish baths. As for M. Dambreuse's office,
a disagreeable spot, what use could he make of it?</p>

<p>These reflections were from time to time rudely
interrupted by the sounds made by the priest in blowing
his nose, or by the good sister in settling the fire.</p>

<p>But the actual facts showed that his thoughts
rested on a solid foundation. The corpse was there.
The eyelids had reopened, and the pupils, although
steeped in clammy gloom, had an enigmatic, intolerable
expression.</p>

<p>Frederick fancied that he saw there a judgment directed
against himself, and he felt almost a sort of remorse,
for he had never any complaint to make against
this man, who, on the contrary&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, now! an old wretch!" and he looked at
the dead man more closely in order to strengthen his
mind, mentally addressing him thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what? Have I killed you?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the priest read his breviary; the nun,
who sat motionless, had fallen asleep. The wicks of
the three wax-tapers had grown longer.</p>

<p>For two hours could be heard the heavy rolling of
carts making their way to the markets. The window-panes
began to admit streaks of white. A cab passed;
then a group of donkeys went trotting over the pavement.
Then came strokes of hammers, cries of itinerant
vendors of wood and blasts of horns. Already
every other sound was blended with the great voice
of awakening Paris.</p>

<p>Frederick went out to perform the duties assigned
to him. He first repaired to the Mayor's office to make
the necessary declaration; then, when the medical officer
had given him a certificate of death, he called a
second time at the municipal buildings in order to
name the cemetery which the family had selected, and
to make arrangements for the funeral ceremonies.</p>

<p>The clerk in the office showed him a plan which
indicated the mode of interment adopted for the various
classes, and a programme giving full particulars
with regard to the spectacular portion of the funeral.
Would he like to have an open funeral-car or a hearse
with plumes, plaits on the horses, and aigrettes on
the footmen, initials or a coat-of-arms, funeral-lamps,
a man to display the family distinctions? and what
number of carriages would he require?</p>

<p>Frederick did not economise in the slightest degree.
Madame Dambreuse was determined to spare no
expense.</p>

<p>After this he made his way to the church.</p>

<p>The curate who had charge of burials found
fault with the waste of money on funeral pomps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
For instance, the officer for the display of armorial
distinctions was really useless. It would be far better
to have a goodly display of wax-tapers. A low mass
accompanied by music would be appropriate.</p>

<p>Frederick gave written directions to have everything
that was agreed upon carried out, with a joint
undertaking to defray all the expenses.</p>

<p>He went next to the H&ocirc;tel de Ville to purchase a
piece of ground. A grant of a piece which was two
metres in length and one in breadth<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> cost five hundred
francs. Did he want a grant for fifty years or
forever?</p>

<p>"Oh, forever!" said Frederick.</p>

<p>He took the whole thing seriously and got into a
state of intense anxiety about it. In the courtyard of
the mansion a marble-cutter was waiting to show
him estimates and plans of Greek, Egyptian, and
Moorish tombs; but the family architect had already
been in consultation with Madame; and on the table
in the vestibule there were all sorts of prospectuses
with reference to the cleaning of mattresses, the disinfection
of rooms, and the various processes of embalming.</p>

<p>After dining, he went back to the tailor's shop to
order mourning for the servants; and he had still to
discharge another function, for the gloves that he had
ordered were of beaver, whereas the right kind for a
funeral were floss-silk.</p>

<p>When he arrived next morning, at ten o'clock, the
large reception-room was filled with people, and
nearly everyone said, on encountering the others, in
a melancholy tone:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is only a month ago since I saw him! Good
heavens! it will be the same way with us all!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but let us try to keep it as far away from
us as possible!"</p>

<p>Then there were little smiles of satisfaction; and
they even engaged in conversations entirely unsuited
to the occasion. At length, the master of the ceremonies,
in a black coat in the French fashion and
short breeches, with a cloak, cambric mourning-bands,
a long sword by his side, and a three-cornered hat
under his arm, gave utterance, with a bow, to the
customary words:</p>

<p>"Messieurs, when it shall be your pleasure."</p>

<p>The funeral started. It was the market-day for
flowers on the Place de la Madeleine. It was a fine
day with brilliant sunshine; and the breeze, which
shook the canvas tents, a little swelled at the edges
the enormous black cloth which was hung over
the church-gate. The escutcheon of M. Dambreuse,
which covered a square piece of velvet, was repeated
there three times. It was: <i>Sable, with an arm sinister
or and a clenched hand with a glove argent</i>;
with the coronet of a count, and this device: <i>By
every path</i>.</p>

<p>The bearers lifted the heavy coffin to the top of
the staircase, and they entered the building. The six
chapels, the hemicycles, and the seats were hung
with black. The catafalque at the end of the choir
formed, with its large wax-tapers, a single focus of
yellow lights. At the two corners, over the candelabra,
flames of spirits of wine were burning.</p>

<p>The persons of highest rank took up their position
in the sanctuary, and the rest in the nave; and then
the Office for the Dead began.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>With the exception of a few, the religious ignorance
of all was so profound that the master of the
ceremonies had, from time to time, to make signs to
them to rise, to kneel, or to resume their seats. The
organ and the two double-basses could be heard alternately
with the voices. In the intervals of silence,
the only sounds that reached the ear were the mumblings
of the priest at the altar; then the music and
the chanting went on again.</p>

<p>The light of day shone dimly through the three
cupolas, but the open door let in, as it were, a stream
of white radiance, which, entering in a horizontal
direction, fell on every uncovered head; and in the
air, half-way towards the ceiling of the church, floated
a shadow, which was penetrated by the reflection of
the gildings that decorated the ribbing of the pendentives
and the foliage of the capitals.</p>

<p>Frederick, in order to distract his attention, listened
to the <i>Dies ir&aelig;</i>. He gazed at those around him, or
tried to catch a glimpse of the pictures hanging too
far above his head, wherein the life of the Magdalen
was represented. Luckily, Pellerin came to sit down
beside him, and immediately plunged into a long dissertation
on the subject of frescoes. The bell began
to toll. They left the church.</p>

<p>The hearse, adorned with hanging draperies and
tall plumes, set out for P&egrave;re-Lachaise drawn by four
black horses, with their manes plaited, their heads
decked with tufts of feathers, and with large trappings
embroidered with silver flowing down to their
shoes. The driver of the vehicle, in Hessian boots,
wore a three-cornered hat with a long piece of crape
falling down from it. The cords were held by four
personages: a questor of the Chamber of Deputies, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
member of the General Council of the Aube, a delegate
from the coal-mining company, and Fumichon, as a
friend. The carriage of the deceased and a dozen
mourning-coaches followed. The persons attending at
the funeral came in the rear, filling up the middle of
the boulevard.</p>

<p>The passers-by stopped to look at the mournful
procession. Women, with their brats in their arms,
got up on chairs, and people, who had been drinking
glasses of beer in the caf&eacute;s, presented themselves at
the windows with billiard-cues in their hands.</p>

<p>The way was long, and, as at formal meals at
which people are at first reserved and then expansive,
the general deportment speedily relaxed. They talked
of nothing but the refusal of an allowance by the
Chamber to the President. M. Piscatory had shown
himself harsh; Montalembert had been "magnificent,
as usual," and MM. Chamballe, Pidoux, Creton, in
short, the entire committee would be compelled perhaps
to follow the advice of MM. Quentin-Bauchard
and Dufour.</p>

<p>This conversation was continued as they passed
through the Rue de la Roquette, with shops on each
side, in which could be seen only chains of coloured
glass and black circular tablets covered with drawings
and letters of gold&mdash;which made them resemble
grottoes full of stalactites and crockery-ware shops.
But, when they had reached the cemetery-gate, everyone
instantaneously ceased speaking.</p>

<p>The tombs among the trees: broken columns, pyramids,
temples, dolmens, obelisks, and Etruscan vaults
with doors of bronze. In some of them might be
seen funereal boudoirs, so to speak, with rustic armchairs
and folding-stools. Spiders' webs hung like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
rags from the little chains of the urns; and the bouquets
of satin ribbons and the crucifixes were covered
with dust. Everywhere, between the balusters on the
tombstones, may be observed crowns of immortelles
and chandeliers, vases, flowers, black discs set off with
gold letters, and plaster statuettes&mdash;little boys or little
girls or little angels sustained in the air by brass wires;
several of them have even a roof of zinc overhead.
Huge cables made of glass strung together, black,
white, or azure, descend from the tops of the monuments
to the ends of the flagstones with long folds,
like boas. The rays of the sun, striking on them,
made them scintillate in the midst of the black wooden
crosses. The hearse advanced along the broad paths,
which are paved like the streets of a city. From
time to time the axletrees cracked. Women, kneeling
down, with their dresses trailing in the grass, addressed
the dead in tones of tenderness. Little white
fumes arose from the green leaves of the yew trees.
These came from offerings that had been left behind,
waste material that had been burnt.</p>

<p>M. Dambreuse's grave was close to the graves of
Manuel and Benjamin Constant. The soil in this place
slopes with an abrupt decline. One has under his
feet there the tops of green trees, further down the
chimneys of steam-pumps, then the entire great city.</p>

<p>Frederick found an opportunity of admiring the
scene while the various addresses were being delivered.</p>

<p>The first was in the name of the Chamber of
Deputies, the second in the name of the General
Council of the Aube, the third in the name of the
coal-mining company of Saone-et-Loire, the fourth in
the name of the Agricultural Society of the Yonne,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and there was another in the name of a Philanthropic
Society. Finally, just as everyone was going
away, a stranger began reading a sixth address, in
the name of the Amiens Society of Antiquaries.</p>

<p>And thereupon they all took advantage of the occasion
to denounce Socialism, of which M. Dambreuse
had died a victim. It was the effect produced on his
mind by the exhibitions of anarchic violence, together
with his devotion to order, that had shortened his
days. They praised his intellectual powers, his integrity,
his generosity, and even his silence as a
representative of the people, "for, if he was not an
orator, he possessed instead those solid qualities a
thousand times more useful," etc., with all the requisite
phrases&mdash;"Premature end; eternal regrets; the better
land; farewell, or rather no, <i>au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p>The clay, mingled with stones, fell on the coffin,
and he would never again be a subject for discussion
in society.</p>

<p>However, there were a few allusions to him as the
persons who had followed his remains left the cemetery.
Hussonnet, who would have to give an account
of the interment in the newspapers, took up all the
addresses in a chaffing style, for, in truth, the worthy
Dambreuse had been one of the most notable <i>pots-de-vin</i><a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
of the last reign. Then the citizens were
driven in the mourning-coaches to their various places
of business; the ceremony had not lasted very long;
they congratulated themselves on the circumstance.</p>

<p>Frederick returned to his own abode quite worn out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>When he presented himself next day at Madame
Dambreuse's residence, he was informed that she was
busy below stairs in the room where M. Dambreuse
had kept his papers.</p>

<p>The cardboard receptacles and the different drawers
had been opened confusedly, and the account-books
had been flung about right and left. A roll of papers
on which were endorsed the words "Repayment
hopeless" lay on the ground. He was near falling
over it, and picked it up. Madame Dambreuse had
sunk back in the armchair, so that he did not see her.</p>

<p>"Well? where are you? What is the matter!"</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet with a bound.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? I am ruined, ruined! do
you understand?"</p>

<p>M. Adolphe Langlois, the notary, had sent her a
message to call at his office, and had informed her
about the contents of a will made by her husband
before their marriage. He had bequeathed everything
to C&eacute;cile; and the other will was lost. Frederick
turned very pale. No doubt she had not made sufficient
search.</p>

<p>"Well, then, look yourself!" said Madame Dambreuse,
pointing at the objects contained in the room.</p>

<p>The two strong-boxes were gaping wide, having
been broken open with blows of a cleaver, and she
had turned up the desk, rummaged in the cupboards,
and shaken the straw-mattings, when, all of a sudden,
uttering a piercing cry, she dashed into corner
where she had just noticed a little box with a brass
lock. She opened it&mdash;nothing!</p>

<p>"Ah! the wretch! I, who took such devoted care
of him!"</p>

<p>Then she burst into sobs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps it is somewhere else?" said Frederick.</p>

<p>"Oh! no! it was there! in that strong-box, I saw
it there lately. 'Tis burned! I'm certain of it!"</p>

<p>One day, in the early stage of his illness, M.
Dambreuse had gone down to this room to sign some
documents.</p>

<p>"'Tis then he must have done the trick!"</p>

<p>And she fell back on a chair, crushed. A mother
grieving beside an empty cradle was not more woeful
than Madame Dambreuse was at the sight of the
open strong-boxes. Indeed, her sorrow, in spite of
the baseness of the motive which inspired it, appeared
so deep that he tried to console her by reminding
her that, after all, she was not reduced to sheer want.</p>

<p>"It is want, when I am not in a position to offer
you a large fortune!"</p>

<p>She had not more than thirty thousand livres a
year, without taking into account the mansion, which
was worth from eighteen to twenty thousand, perhaps.</p>

<p>Although to Frederick this would have been opulence,
he felt, none the less, a certain amount of disappointment.
Farewell to his dreams and to all the
splendid existence on which he had intended to enter!
Honour compelled him to marry Madame Dambreuse.
For a minute he reflected; then, in a tone of tenderness:</p>

<p>"I'll always have yourself!"</p>

<p>She threw herself into his arms, and he clasped
her to his breast with an emotion in which there
was a slight element of admiration for himself.</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse, whose tears had ceased to
flow, raised her face, beaming all over with happiness,
and seizing his hand:</p>

<p>"Ah! I never doubted you! I knew I could count
on you!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man did not like this tone of anticipated
certainty with regard to what he was pluming
himself on as a noble action.</p>

<p>Then she brought him into her own apartment,
and they began to arrange their plans for the future.
Frederick should now consider the best way of advancing
himself in life. She even gave him excellent
advice with reference to his candidature.</p>

<p>The first point was to be acquainted with two or
three phrases borrowed from political economy. It
was necessary to take up a specialty, such as the
stud system, for example; to write a number of notes
on questions of local interest, to have always at his
disposal post-offices or tobacconists' shops, and to
do a heap of little services. In this respect M. Dambreuse
had shown himself a true model. Thus, on
one occasion, in the country, he had drawn up his
wagonette, full of friends of his, in front of a cobbler's
stall, and had bought a dozen pairs of shoes for
his guests, and for himself a dreadful pair of boots,
which he had not even the courage to wear for an
entire fortnight. This anecdote put them into a good
humour. She related others, and that with a renewal
of grace, youthfulness, and wit.</p>

<p>She approved of his notion of taking a trip immediately
to Nogent. Their parting was an affectionate
one; then, on the threshold, she murmured once more:</p>

<p>"You love me&mdash;do you not?"</p>

<p>"Eternally," was his reply.</p>

<p>A messenger was waiting for him at his own
house with a line written in lead-pencil informing him
that Rosanette was about to be confined. He had
been so much preoccupied for the past few days that
he had not bestowed a thought upon the matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>She had been placed in a special establishment at
Chaillot.</p>

<p>Frederick took a cab and set out for this institution.</p>

<p>At the corner of the Rue de Marbeuf he read on a
board in big letters: "Private Lying-in-Hospital,
kept by Madame Alessandri, first-class midwife, ex-pupil
of the Maternity, author of various works, etc."
Then, in the centre of the street, over the door&mdash;a
little side-door&mdash;there was another sign-board: "Private
Hospital of Madame Alessandri," with all her titles.</p>

<p>Frederick gave a knock. A chambermaid, with
the figure of an Abigail, introduced him into the reception-room,
which was adorned with a mahogany
table and armchairs of garnet velvet, and with a clock
under a globe.</p>

<p>Almost immediately Madame appeared. She was
a tall brunette of forty, with a slender waist, fine
eyes, and the manners of good society. She apprised
Frederick of the mother's happy delivery, and brought
him up to her apartment.</p>

<p>Rosanette broke into a smile of unutterable bliss,
and, as if drowned in the floods of love that were
suffocating her, she said in a low tone:</p>

<p>"A boy&mdash;there, there!" pointing towards a cradle
close to her bed.</p>

<p>He flung open the curtains, and saw, wrapped up
in linen, a yellowish-red object, exceedingly shrivelled-looking,
which had a bad smell, and which was
bawling lustily.</p>

<p>"Embrace him!"</p>

<p>He replied, in order to hide his repugnance:</p>

<p>"But I am afraid of hurting him."</p>

<p>"No! no!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, with the tips of his lips, he kissed his child.</p>

<p>"How like you he is!"</p>

<p>And with her two weak arms, she clung to his
neck with an outburst of feeling which he had never
witnessed on her part before.</p>

<p>The remembrance of Madame Dambreuse came
back to him. He reproached himself as a monster
for having deceived this poor creature, who loved and
suffered with all the sincerity of her nature. For
several days he remained with her till night.</p>

<p>She felt happy in this quiet place; the window-shutters
in front of it remained always closed. Her
room, hung with bright chintz, looked out on a large
garden. Madame Alessandri, whose only shortcoming
was that she liked to talk about her intimate acquaintanceship
with eminent physicians, showed her the
utmost attention. Her associates, nearly all provincial
young ladies, were exceedingly bored, as they had
nobody to come to see them. Rosanette saw that
they regarded her with envy, and told this to Frederick
with pride. It was desirable to speak low,
nevertheless. The partitions were thin, and everyone
stood listening at hiding-places, in spite of the constant
thrumming of the pianos.</p>

<p>At last, he was about to take his departure for
Nogent, when he got a letter from Deslauriers. Two
fresh candidates had offered themselves, the one a
Conservative, the other a Red; a third, whatever he
might be, would have no chance. It was all Frederick's
fault; he had let the lucky moment pass by;
he should have come sooner and stirred himself.</p>

<p>"You have not even been seen at the agricultural
assembly!" The advocate blamed him for not having
any newspaper connection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! if you had followed my advice long ago! If
we had only a public print of our own!"</p>

<p>He laid special stress on this point. However,
many persons who would have voted for him out of
consideration for M. Dambreuse, abandoned him now.
Deslauriers was one of the number. Not having anything
more to expect from the capitalist, he had
thrown over his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>Frederick took the letter to show it to Madame
Dambreuse.</p>

<p>"You have not been to Nogent, then?" said she.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I saw Deslauriers three days ago."</p>

<p>Having learned that her husband was dead, the
advocate had come to make a report about the coal-mines,
and to offer his services to her as a man of
business. This seemed strange to Frederick; and what
was his friend doing down there?</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse wanted to know how he had
spent his time since they had parted.</p>

<p>"I have been ill," he replied.</p>

<p>"You ought at least to have told me about it."</p>

<p>"Oh! it wasn't worth while;" besides, he had to
settle a heap of things, to keep appointments and to
pay visits.</p>

<p>From that time forth he led a double life, sleeping
religiously at the Mar&eacute;chale's abode and passing the
afternoon with Madame Dambreuse, so that there was
scarcely a single hour of freedom left to him in the
middle of the day.</p>

<p>The infant was in the country at Andilly. They
went to see it once a week.</p>

<p>The wet-nurse's house was on rising ground in the
village, at the end of a little yard as dark as a pit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
with straw on the ground, hens here and there, and a
vegetable-cart under the shed.</p>

<p>Rosanette would begin by frantically kissing her
baby, and, seized with a kind of delirium, would keep
moving to and fro, trying to milk the she-goat, eating
big pieces of bread, and inhaling the odour of
manure; she even wanted to put a little of it into her
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Then they took long walks, in the course of which
she went into the nurseries, tore off branches from
the lilac-trees which hung down over the walls, and
exclaimed, "Gee ho, donkey!" to the asses that were
drawing cars along, and stopped to gaze through the
gate into the interior of one of the lovely gardens; or
else the wet-nurse would take the child and place it
under the shade of a walnut-tree; and for hours the two
women would keep talking the most tiresome nonsense.</p>

<p>Frederick, not far away from them, gazed at the
beds of vines on the slopes, with here and there a
clump of trees; at the dusty paths resembling strips of
grey ribbon; at the houses, which showed white and
red spots in the midst of the greenery; and sometimes
the smoke of a locomotive stretched out horizontally
to the bases of the hills, covered with foliage,
like a gigantic ostrich's feather, the thin end of which
was disappearing from view.</p>

<p>Then his eyes once more rested on his son. He
imagined the child grown into a young man; he would
make a companion of him; but perhaps he would be
a blockhead, a wretched creature, in any event. He
was always oppressed by the illegality of the infant's
birth; it would have been better if he had never been
born! And Frederick would murmur, "Poor child!"
his heart swelling with feelings of unutterable sadness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>They often missed the last train. Then Madame
Dambreuse would scold him for his want of punctuality.
He would invent some falsehood.</p>

<p>It was necessary to invent some explanations, too,
to satisfy Rosanette. She could not understand how
he spent all his evenings; and when she sent a messenger
to his house, he was never there! One day,
when he chanced to be at home, the two women
made their appearance almost at the same time. He
got the Mar&eacute;chale to go away, and concealed Madame
Dambreuse, pretending that his mother was coming
up to Paris.</p>

<p>Ere long, he found these lies amusing. He would
repeat to one the oath which he had just uttered to
the other, send them bouquets of the same sort, write
to them at the same time, and then would institute
a comparison between them. There was a third always
present in his thoughts. The impossibility of
possessing her seemed to him a justification of his
perfidies, which were intensified by the fact that he
had to practise them alternately; and the more he deceived,
no matter which of the two, the fonder of him
she grew, as if the love of one of them added heat
to that of the other, and, as if by a sort of emulation,
each of them were seeking to make him forget the
other.</p>

<p>"Admire my confidence in you!" said Madame
Dambreuse one day to him, opening a sheet of paper,
in which she was informed that M. Moreau and
a certain Rose Bron were living together as husband
and wife.</p>

<p>"Can it be that this is the lady of the races?"</p>

<p>"What an absurdity!" he returned. "Let me
have a look at it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter, written in Roman characters, had no
signature. Madame Dambreuse, in the beginning, had
tolerated this mistress, who furnished a cloak for their
adultery. But, as her passion became stronger, she
had insisted on a rupture&mdash;a thing which had been
effected long since, according to Frederick's account;
and when he had ceased to protest, she replied, half
closing her eyes, in which shone a look like the
point of a stiletto under a muslin robe:</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and the other?"</p>

<p>"What other?"</p>

<p>"The earthenware-dealer's wife!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. She did
not press the matter.</p>

<p>But, a month later, while they were talking about
honour and loyalty, and he was boasting about his
own (in a casual sort of way, for the sake of precaution),
she said to him:</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;you are acting uprightly&mdash;you don't
go back there any more?"</p>

<p>Frederick, who was at the moment thinking of the
Mar&eacute;chale, stammered:</p>

<p>"Where, pray?"</p>

<p>"To Madame Arnoux's."</p>

<p>He implored her to tell him from whom she got
the information. It was through her second dressmaker,
Madame Regimbart.</p>

<p>So, she knew all about his life, and he knew
nothing about hers!</p>

<p>In the meantime, he had found in her dressing-room
the miniature of a gentleman with long moustaches&mdash;was
this the same person about whose
suicide a vague story had been told him at one time?
But there was no way of learning any more about it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
However, what was the use of it? The hearts of
women are like little pieces of furniture wherein
things are secreted, full of drawers fitted into each
other; one hurts himself, breaks his nails in opening
them, and then finds within only some withered
flower, a few grains of dust&mdash;or emptiness! And
then perhaps he felt afraid of learning too much about
the matter.</p>

<p>She made him refuse invitations where she was
unable to accompany him, stuck to his side, was
afraid of losing him; and, in spite of this union
which was every day becoming stronger, all of a
sudden, abysses disclosed themselves between the
pair about the most trifling questions&mdash;an estimate
of an individual or a work of art.</p>

<p>She had a style of playing on the piano which was
correct and hard. Her spiritualism (Madame Dambreuse
believed in the transmigration of souls into the stars)
did not prevent her from taking the utmost care of
her cash-box. She was haughty towards her servants;
her eyes remained dry at the sight of the rags of the
poor. In the expressions of which she habitually
made use a candid egoism manifested itself: "What
concern is that of mine? I should be very silly!
What need have I?" and a thousand little acts incapable
of analysis revealed hateful qualities in her. She
would have listened behind doors; she could not help
lying to her confessor. Through a spirit of despotism,
she insisted on Frederick going to the church with her
on Sunday. He obeyed, and carried her prayer-book.</p>

<p>The loss of the property she had expected to inherit
had changed her considerably. These marks of
grief, which people attributed to the death of M. Dambreuse,
rendered her interesting, and, as in former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
times, she had a great number of visitors. Since
Frederick's defeat at the election, she was ambitious
of obtaining for both of them an embassy in Germany;
therefore, the first thing they should do was
to submit to the reigning ideas.</p>

<p>Some persons were in favour of the Empire, others
of the Orl&eacute;ans family, and others of the Comte de
Chambord; but they were all of one opinion as to
the urgency of decentralisation, and several expedients
were proposed with that view, such as to cut up
Paris into many large streets in order to establish
villages there, to transfer the seat of government to
Versailles, to have the schools set up at Bourges,
to suppress the libraries, and to entrust everything to
the generals of division; and they glorified a rustic
existence on the assumption that the uneducated man
had naturally more sense than other men! Hatreds
increased&mdash;hatred of primary teachers and wine-merchants,
of the classes of philosophy, of the courses of
lectures on history, of novels, red waistcoats, long
beards, of independence in any shape, or any manifestation
of individuality, for it was necessary "to restore
the principle of authority"&mdash;let it be exercised
in the name of no matter whom; let it come from no
matter where, as long as it was Force, Authority!
The Conservatives now talked in the very same way
as S&eacute;n&eacute;cal. Frederick was no longer able to understand
their drift, and once more he found at the house
of his former mistress the same remarks uttered by
the same men.</p>

<p>The salons of the unmarried women (it was from
this period that their importance dates) were a sort of
neutral ground where reactionaries of different kinds
met. Hussonnet, who gave himself up to the depre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>ciation
of contemporary glories (a good thing for the
restoration of Order), inspired Rosanette with a longing
to have evening parties like any other. He undertook
to publish accounts of them, and first of all
he brought a man of grave deportment, Fumichon;
then came Nonancourt, M. de Gr&eacute;monville, the Sieur
de Larsilloix, ex-prefect, and Cisy, who was now an
agriculturist in Lower Brittany, and more Christian
than ever.</p>

<p>In addition, men who had at one time been the
Mar&eacute;chale's lovers, such as the Baron de Comaing,
the Comte de Jumillac, and others, presented themselves;
and Frederick was annoyed by their free-and-easy
behaviour.</p>

<p>In order that he might assume the attitude of
master in the house, he increased the rate of expenditure
there. Then he went in for keeping a groom, took
a new habitation, and got a fresh supply of furniture.
These displays of extravagance were useful for the
purpose of making his alliance appear less out of proportion
with his pecuniary position. The result was
that his means were soon terribly reduced&mdash;and
Rosanette was entirely ignorant of the fact!</p>

<p>One of the lower middle-class, who had lost caste,
she adored a domestic life, a quiet little home. However,
it gave her pleasure to have "an at home day."
In referring to persons of her own class, she called
them "Those women!" She wished to be a society
lady, and believed herself to be one. She begged of
him not to smoke in the drawing-room any more,
and for the sake of good form tried to make herself
look thin.</p>

<p>She played her part badly, after all; for she grew
serious, and even before going to bed always ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>hibited
a little melancholy, just as there are cypress
trees at the door of a tavern.</p>

<p>He found out the cause of it; she was dreaming of
marriage&mdash;she, too! Frederick was exasperated at
this. Besides, he recalled to mind her appearance at
Madame Arnoux's house, and then he cherished a certain
spite against her for having held out against him
so long.</p>

<p>He made enquiries none the less as to who her
lovers had been. She denied having had any relations
with any of the persons he mentioned. A sort of
jealous feeling took possession of him. He irritated
her by asking questions about presents that had been
made to her, and were still being made to her; and
in proportion to the exciting effect which the lower
portion of her nature produced upon him, he was
drawn towards her by momentary illusions which
ended in hate.</p>

<p>Her words, her voice, her smile, all had an unpleasant
effect on him, and especially her glances with
that woman's eye forever limpid and foolish. Sometimes
he felt so tired of her that he would have seen
her die without being moved at it. But how could
he get into a passion with her? She was so mild
that there was no hope of picking a quarrel with her.</p>

<p>Deslauriers reappeared, and explained his sojourn
at Nogent by saying that he was making arrangements
to buy a lawyer's office. Frederick was glad
to see him again. It was somebody! and as a third
person in the house, he helped to break the monotony.</p>

<p>The advocate dined with them from time to time,
and whenever any little disputes arose, always took
Rosanette's part, so that Frederick, on one occasion,
said to him:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! you can have with her, if it amuses you!"
so much did he long for some chance of getting rid
of her.</p>

<p>About the middle of the month of June, she was
served with an order made by the law courts by
which Ma&icirc;tre Athanase Gautherot, sheriff's officer,
called on her to pay him four thousand francs due to
Mademoiselle Clemence Vatnaz; if not, he would
come to make a seizure on her.</p>

<p>In fact, of the four bills which she had at various
times signed, only one had been paid; the money
which she happened to get since then having been
spent on other things that she required.</p>

<p>She rushed off at once to see Arnoux. He lived
now in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and the porter
was unable to tell her the name of the street. She
made her way next to the houses of several friends
of hers, could not find one of them at home, and
came back in a state of utter despair.</p>

<p>She did not wish to tell Frederick anything about
it, fearing lest this new occurrence might prejudice
the chance of a marriage between them.</p>

<p>On the following morning, M. Athanase Gautherot
presented himself with two assistants close behind
him, one of them sallow with a mean-looking face
and an expression of devouring envy in his glance,
the other wearing a collar and straps drawn very
tightly, with a sort of thimble of black taffeta on his
index-finger&mdash;and both ignobly dirty, with greasy
necks, and the sleeves of their coats too short.</p>

<p>Their employer, a very good-looking man, on the
contrary, began by apologising for the disagreeable
duty he had to perform, while at the same time he
threw a look round the room, "full of pretty things,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
upon my word of honour!" He added, "Not to
speak of the things that can't be seized." At a gesture
the two bailiff's men disappeared.</p>

<p>Then he became twice as polite as before. Could
anyone believe that a lady so charming would not
have a genuine friend! A sale of her goods under an
order of the courts would be a real misfortune. One
never gets over a thing like that. He tried to excite
her fears; then, seeing that she was very much agitated,
suddenly assumed a paternal tone. He knew
the world. He had been brought into business relations
with all these ladies&mdash;and as he mentioned
their names, he examined the frames of the pictures
on the walls. They were old pictures of the worthy
Arnoux, sketches by Sombary, water-colours by Burieu,
and three landscapes by Dittmer. It was evident
that Rosanette was ignorant of their value,
Ma&icirc;tre Gautherot turned round to her:</p>

<p>"Look here! to show that I am a decent fellow,
do one thing: give me up those Dittmers here&mdash;and
I am ready to pay all. Do you agree?"</p>

<p>At that moment Frederick, who had been informed
about the matter by Delphine in the anteroom, and
who had just seen the two assistants, came in with
his hat on his head, in a rude fashion. Ma&icirc;tre
Gautherot resumed his dignity; and, as the door had
been left open:</p>

<p>"Come on, gentlemen&mdash;write down! In the second
room, let us say&mdash;an oak table with its two
leaves, two sideboards&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frederick here stopped him, asking whether there
was not some way of preventing the seizure.</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly! Who paid for the furniture?"</p>

<p>"I did."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, draw up a claim&mdash;you have still time to
do it."</p>

<p>Ma&icirc;tre Gautherot did not take long in writing out his
official report, wherein he directed that Mademoiselle
Bron should attend at an enquiry in chambers
with reference to the ownership of the furniture, and
having done this he withdrew.</p>

<p>Frederick uttered no reproach. He gazed at the
traces of mud left on the floor by the bailiff's shoes,
and, speaking to himself:</p>

<p>"It will soon be necessary to look about for
money!"</p>

<p>"Ah! my God, how stupid I am!" said the Mar&eacute;chale.</p>

<p>She ransacked a drawer, took out a letter, and
made her way rapidly to the Languedoc Gas Lighting
Company, in order to get the transfer of her shares.</p>

<p>She came back an hour later. The interest in the
shares had been sold to another. The clerk had said,
in answer to her demand, while examining the sheet
of paper containing Arnoux's written promise to her:
"This document in no way constitutes you the proprietor
of the shares. The company has no cognisance
of the matter." In short, he sent her away
unceremoniously, while she choked with rage; and
Frederick would have to go to Arnoux's house at once
to have the matter cleared up.</p>

<p>But Arnoux would perhaps imagine that he had
come to recover in an indirect fashion the fifteen thousand
francs due on the mortgage which he had lost;
and then this claim from a man who had been his
mistress's lover seemed to him a piece of baseness.</p>

<p>Selecting a middle course, he went to the Dambreuse
mansion to get Madame Regimbart's address,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
sent a messenger to her residence, and in this way
ascertained the name of the caf&eacute; which the Citizen
now haunted.</p>

<p>It was the little caf&eacute; on the Place de la Bastille,
in which he sat all day in the corner to the right at
the lower end of the establishment, never moving any
more than if he were a portion of the building.</p>

<p>After having gone successively through the half-cup
of coffee, the glass of grog, the "bishop," the
glass of mulled wine, and even the red wine and
water, he fell back on beer, and every half hour he
let fall this word, "Bock!" having reduced his language
to what was actually indispensable. Frederick
asked him if he saw Arnoux occasionally.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"An imbecile!"</p>

<p>Politics, perhaps, kept them apart, and so Frederick
thought it a judicious thing to enquire about Compain.</p>

<p>"What a brute!" said Regimbart.</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"His calf's head!"</p>

<p>"Ha! explain to me what the calf's head is!"</p>

<p>Regimbart's face wore a contemptuous smile.</p>

<p>"Some tomfoolery!"</p>

<p>After a long interval of silence, Frederick went on
to ask:</p>

<p>"So, then, he has changed his address?"</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Arnoux!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Rue de Fleurus!"</p>

<p>"What number?"</p>

<p>"Do I associate with the Jesuits?"</p>

<p>"What, Jesuits!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The Citizen replied angrily:</p>

<p>"With the money of a patriot whom I introduced
to him, this pig has set up as a dealer in beads!"</p>

<p>"It isn't possible!"</p>

<p>"Go there, and see for yourself!"</p>

<p>It was perfectly true; Arnoux, enfeebled by a fit
of sickness, had turned religious; besides, he had
always had a stock of religion in his composition,
and (with that mixture of commercialism and ingenuity
which was natural to him), in order to gain salvation
and fortune both together, he had begun to
traffick in religious objects.</p>

<p>Frederick had no difficulty in discovering his establishment,
on whose signboard appeared these
words: "<i>Emporium of Gothic Art</i>&mdash;Restoration of
articles used in ecclesiastical ceremonies&mdash;Church ornaments&mdash;Polychromatic
sculpture&mdash;Frankincense of
the Magi, Kings, &amp;c., &amp;c."</p>

<p>At the two corners of the shop-window rose two
wooden statues, streaked with gold, cinnabar, and
azure, a Saint John the Baptist with his sheepskin,
and a Saint Genevieve with roses in her apron and a
distaff under her arm; next, groups in plaster, a good
sister teaching a little girl, a mother on her knees beside
a little bed, and three collegians before the holy
table. The prettiest object there was a kind of ch&acirc;let
representing the interior of a crib with the ass, the
ox, and the child Jesus stretched on straw&mdash;real
straw. From the top to the bottom of the shelves
could be seen medals by the dozen, every sort of
beads, holy-water basins in the form of shells, and
portraits of ecclesiastical dignitaries, amongst whom
Monsignor Affre and our Holy Father shone forth with
smiles on their faces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>Arnoux sat asleep at his counter with his head
down. He had aged terribly. He had even round
his temples a wreath of rosebuds, and the reflection
of the gold crosses touched by the rays of the sun
fell over him.</p>

<p>Frederick was filled with sadness at this spectacle
of decay. Through devotion to the Mar&eacute;chale he,
however, submitted to the ordeal, and stepped forward.
At the end of the shop Madame Arnoux
showed herself; thereupon, he turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"I couldn't see him," he said, when he came back
to Rosanette.</p>

<p>And in vain he went on to promise that he would
write at once to his notary at Havre for some money&mdash;she
flew into a rage. She had never seen a man
so weak, so flabby. While she was enduring a thousand
privations, other people were enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>Frederick was thinking about poor Madame Arnoux,
and picturing to himself the heart-rending impoverishment
of her surroundings. He had seated
himself before the writing-desk; and, as Rosanette's
voice still kept up its bitter railing:</p>

<p>"Ah! in the name of Heaven, hold your tongue!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are going to defend them?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes!" he exclaimed; "for what's the cause
of this display of fury?"</p>

<p>"But why is it that you don't want to make them
pay up? 'Tis for fear of vexing your old flame&mdash;confess
it!"</p>

<p>He felt an inclination to smash her head with the
timepiece. Words failed him. He relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Rosanette, as she walked up and down the room,
continued:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am going to hurl a writ at this Arnoux of yours.
Oh! I don't want your assistance. I'll get legal advice."</p>

<p>Three days later, Delphine rushed abruptly into the
room where her mistress sat.</p>

<p>"Madame! madame! there's a man here with a pot
of paste who has given me a fright!"</p>

<p>Rosanette made her way down to the kitchen, and
saw there a vagabond whose face was pitted with
smallpox. Moreover, one of his arms was paralysed,
and he was three fourths drunk, and hiccoughed
every time he attempted to speak.</p>

<p>This was Ma&icirc;tre Gautherot's bill-sticker. The objections
raised against the seizure having been overruled,
the sale followed as a matter of course.</p>

<p>For his trouble in getting up the stairs he demanded,
in the first place, a half-glass of brandy;
then he wanted another favour, namely, tickets for the
theatre, on the assumption that the lady of the house
was an actress. After this he indulged for some
minutes in winks, whose import was perfectly incomprehensible.
Finally, he declared that for forty
sous he would tear off the corners of the poster
which he had already affixed to the door below
stairs. Rosanette found herself referred to by name
in it&mdash;a piece of exceptional harshness which showed
the spite of the Vatnaz.</p>

<p>She had at one time exhibited sensibility, and had
even, while suffering from the effects of a heartache,
written to B&eacute;ranger for his advice. But under the
ravages of life's storms, her spirit had become soured,
for she had been forced, in turn, to give lessons on
the piano, to act as manageress of a <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>, to
assist others in writing for the fashion journals, to
sublet apartments, and to traffic in lace in the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of light women, her relations with whom enabled
her to make herself useful to many persons, and
amongst others to Arnoux. She had formerly been
employed in a commercial establishment.</p>

<p>There it was one of her functions to pay the workwomen;
and for each of them there were two livres,
one of which always remained in her hands. Dussardier,
who, through kindness, kept the amount payable
to a girl named Hortense Baslin, presented himself one
day at the cash-office at the moment when Mademoiselle
Vatnaz was presenting this girl's account,
1,682 francs, which the cashier paid her. Now, on
the very day before this, Dussardier had entered down
the sum as 1,082 in the girl Baslin's book. He asked
to have it given back to him on some pretext; then,
anxious to bury out of sight the story of this theft, he
stated that he had lost it. The workwoman ingenuously
repeated this falsehood to Mademoiselle Vatnaz,
and the latter, in order to satisfy her mind about the
matter, came with a show of indifference to talk to
the shopman on the subject. He contented himself
with the answer: "I have burned it!"&mdash;that was all.
A little while afterwards she quitted the house, without
believing that the book had been really destroyed, and
filled with the idea that Dussardier had preserved it.</p>

<p>On hearing that he had been wounded, she rushed
to his abode, with the object of getting it back.
Then, having discovered nothing, in spite of the
closest searches, she was seized with respect, and
presently with love, for this youth, so loyal, so gentle,
so heroic and so strong! At her age such good fortune
in an affair of the heart was a thing that one
would not expect. She threw herself into it with the
appetite of an ogress; and she had given up literature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Socialism, "the consoling doctrines and the generous
Utopias," the course of lectures which she had projected
on the "Desubalternization of Woman"&mdash;everything,
even Delmar himself; finally she offered to
unite herself to Dussardier in marriage.</p>

<p>Although she was his mistress, he was not at all
in love with her. Besides, he had not forgotten her
theft. Then she was too wealthy for him. He refused
her offer. Thereupon, with tears in her eyes,
she told him about what she had dreamed&mdash;it was to
have for both of them a confectioner's shop. She
possessed the capital that was required beforehand for
the purpose, and next week this would be increased
to the extent of four thousand francs. By way of explanation,
she referred to the proceedings she had
taken against the Mar&eacute;chale.</p>

<p>Dussardier was annoyed at this on account of his
friend. He recalled to mind the cigar-holder that had
been presented to him at the guard-house, the evenings
spent in the Quai Napol&eacute;on, the many pleasant
chats, the books lent to him, the thousand acts of
kindness which Frederick had done in his behalf. He
begged of the Vatnaz to abandon the proceedings.</p>

<p>She rallied him on his good nature, while exhibiting
an antipathy against Rosanette which he could
not understand. She longed only for wealth, in fact,
in order to crush her, by-and-by, with her four-wheeled
carriage.</p>

<p>Dussardier was terrified by these black abysses of
hate, and when he had ascertained what was the exact
day fixed for the sale, he hurried out. On the
following morning he made his appearance at Frederick's
house with an embarrassed countenance.</p>

<p>"I owe you an apology."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"For what, pray?"</p>

<p>"You must take me for an ingrate, I, whom she
is the&mdash;&mdash;" He faltered.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'll see no more of her. I am not going
to be her accomplice!" And as the other was gazing
at him in astonishment:</p>

<p>"Isn't your mistress's furniture to be sold in three
days' time?"</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Herself&mdash;the Vatnaz! But I am afraid of giving
you offence&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Impossible, my dear friend!"</p>

<p>"Ah! that is true&mdash;you are so good!"</p>

<p>And he held out to him, in a cautious fashion, a
hand in which he clasped a little pocket-book made
of sheep-leather.</p>

<p>It contained four thousand francs&mdash;all his savings.</p>

<p>"What! Oh! no! no!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>"I knew well I would wound your feelings," returned
Dussardier, with a tear in the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>Frederick pressed his hand, and the honest fellow
went on in a piteous tone:</p>

<p>"Take the money! Give me that much pleasure!
I am in such a state of despair. Can it be, furthermore,
that all is over? I thought we should be
happy when the Revolution had come. Do you remember
what a beautiful thing it was? how freely
we breathed! But here we are flung back into a
worse condition of things than ever.</p>

<p>"Now, they are killing our Republic, just as they
killed the other one&mdash;the Roman! ay, and poor
Venice! poor Poland! poor Hungary! What abominable
deeds! First of all, they knocked down the
trees of Liberty, then they restricted the right to vote,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
shut up the clubs, re-established the censorship and
surrendered to the priests the power of teaching, so
that we might look out for the Inquisition. Why
not? The Conservatives want to give us a taste of
the stick. The newspapers are fined merely for pronouncing
an opinion in favour of abolishing the
death-penalty. Paris is overflowing with bayonets;
sixteen departments are in a state of siege; and then
the demand for amnesty is again rejected!"</p>

<p>He placed both hands on his forehead, then,
spreading out his arms as if his mind were in a distracted
state:</p>

<p>"If, however, we only made the effort! if we
were only sincere, we might understand each other.
But no! The workmen are no better than the capitalists,
you see! At Elb&oelig;uf recently they refused to
help at a fire! There are wretches who profess to
regard Barb&egrave;s as an aristocrat! In order to make the
people ridiculous, they want to get nominated for the
presidency Nadaud, a mason&mdash;just imagine! And
there is no way out of it&mdash;no remedy! Everybody
is against us! For my part, I have never done any
harm; and yet this is like a weight pressing down
on my stomach. If this state of things continues, I'll
go mad. I have a mind to do away with myself. I
tell you I want no money for myself! You'll pay it
back to me, deuce take it! I am lending it to you."</p>

<p>Frederick, who felt himself constrained by necessity,
ended by taking the four thousand francs from
him. And so they had no more disquietude so far as
the Vatnaz was concerned.</p>

<p>But it was not long ere Rosanette was defeated in
her action against Arnoux; and through sheer obstinacy
she wished to appeal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Deslauriers exhausted his energies in trying to
make her understand that Arnoux's promise constituted
neither a gift nor a regular transfer. She did
not even pay the slightest attention to him, her notion
being that the law was unjust&mdash;it was because she was
a woman; men backed up each other amongst themselves.
In the end, however, she followed his advice.</p>

<p>He made himself so much at home in the house,
that on several occasions he brought S&eacute;n&eacute;cal to dine
there. Frederick, who had advanced him money, and
even got his own tailor to supply him with clothes,
did not like this unceremoniousness; and the advocate
gave his old clothes to the Socialist, whose means of
existence were now of an exceedingly uncertain character.</p>

<p>He was, however, anxious to be of service to
Rosanette. One day, when she showed him a dozen
shares in the Kaolin Company (that enterprise which
led to Arnoux being cast in damages to the extent of
thirty thousand francs), he said to her:</p>

<p>"But this is a shady transaction, and you have
now a grand chance!"</p>

<p>She had the right to call on him to pay her debts.
In the first place, she could prove that he was jointly
bound to pay all the company's liabilities, since he
had certified personal debts as collective debts&mdash;in
short, he had embezzled sums which were payable
only to the company.</p>

<p>"All this renders him guilty of fraudulent bankruptcy
under articles 586 and 587 of the Commercial
Code, and you may be sure, my pet, we'll send him
packing."</p>

<p>Rosanette threw herself on his neck. He entrusted
her case next day to his former master, not having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
time to devote attention to it himself, as he had business
at Nogent. In case of any urgency, S&eacute;n&eacute;cal
could write to him.</p>

<p>His negotiations for the purchase of an office were
a mere pretext. He spent his time at M. Roque's house,
where he had begun not only by sounding the praises
of their friend, but by imitating his manners and language
as much as possible; and in this way he had
gained Louise's confidence, while he won over that of
her father by making an attack on Ledru-Rollin.</p>

<p>If Frederick did not return, it was because he
mingled in aristocratic society, and gradually Deslauriers
gave them to understand that he was in love
with somebody, that he had a child, and that he was
keeping a fallen creature.</p>

<p>The despair of Louise was intense. The indignation
of Madame Moreau was not less strong. She
saw her son whirling towards the bottom of a gulf
the depth of which could not be determined, was
wounded in her religious ideas as to propriety, and as
it were, experienced a sense of personal dishonour;
then all of a sudden her physiognomy underwent a
change. To the questions which people put to her
with regard to Frederick, she replied in a sly fashion:</p>

<p>"He is well, quite well."'</p>

<p>She was aware that he was about to be married
to Madame Dambreuse.</p>

<p>The date of the event had been fixed, and he was
even trying to think of some way of making Rosanette
swallow the thing.</p>

<p>About the middle of autumn she won her action
with reference to the kaolin shares. Frederick was
informed about it by S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, whom he met at his
own door, on his way back from the courts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been held that M. Arnoux was privy to all
the frauds, and the ex-tutor had such an air of making
merry over it that Frederick prevented him from coming
further, assuring S&eacute;n&eacute;cal that he would convey
the intelligence to Rosanette. He presented himself
before her with a look of irritation on his face.</p>

<p>"Well, now you are satisfied!"</p>

<p>But, without minding what he had said:</p>

<p>"Look here!"</p>

<p>And she pointed towards her child, which was
lying in a cradle close to the fire. She had found it
so sick at the house of the wet-nurse that morning
that she had brought it back with her to Paris.</p>

<p>All the infant's limbs were exceedingly thin, and
the lips were covered with white specks, which in
the interior of the mouth became, so to speak, clots
of blood-stained milk.</p>

<p>"What did the doctor say?"</p>

<p>"Oh! the doctor! He pretends that the journey
has increased his&mdash;I don't know what it is, some
name in 'ite'&mdash;in short, that he has the thrush.<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
Do you know what that is?"</p>

<p>Frederick replied without hesitation: "Certainly,"
adding that it was nothing.</p>

<p>But in the evening he was alarmed by the child's
debilitated look and by the progress of these whitish
spots, resembling mould, as if life, already abandoning
this little frame, had left now nothing but matter
from which vegetation was sprouting. His hands
were cold; he was no longer able to drink anything;
and the nurse, another woman, whom the porter had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
gone and taken on chance at an office, kept repeating:</p>

<p>"It seems to me he's very low, very low!"</p>

<p>Rosanette was up all night with the child.</p>

<p>In the morning she went to look for Frederick.</p>

<p>"Just come and look at him. He doesn't move
any longer."</p>

<p>In fact, he was dead. She took him up, shook
him, clasped him in her arms, calling him most tender
names, covered him with kisses, broke into sobs,
turned herself from one side to the other in a state
of distraction, tore her hair, uttered a number of
shrieks, and then let herself sink on the edge of the
divan, where she lay with her mouth open and a
flood of tears rushing from her wildly-glaring eyes.</p>

<p>Then a torpor fell upon her, and all became still
in the apartment. The furniture was overturned.
Two or three napkins were lying on the floor. It
struck six. The night-light had gone out.</p>

<p>Frederick, as he gazed at the scene, could almost
believe that he was dreaming. His heart was oppressed
with anguish. It seemed to him that this
death was only a beginning, and that behind it was
a worse calamity, which was just about to come on.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Rosanette said in an appealing tone:</p>

<p>"We'll preserve the body&mdash;shall we not?"</p>

<p>She wished to have the dead child embalmed.
There were many objections to this. The principal
one, in Frederick's opinion, was that the thing
was impracticable in the case of children so young.
A portrait would be better. She adopted this idea.
He wrote a line to Pellerin, and Delphine hastened to
deliver it.</p>

<p>Pellerin arrived speedily, anxious by this display of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
zeal to efface all recollection of his former conduct.
The first thing he said was:</p>

<p>"Poor little angel! Ah, my God, what a misfortune!"</p>

<p>But gradually (the artist in him getting the upper
hand) he declared that nothing could be made out of
those yellowish eyes, that livid face, that it was a
real case of still-life, and would, therefore, require
very great talent to treat it effectively; and so he
murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, 'tisn't easy&mdash;'tisn't easy!"</p>

<p>"No matter, as long as it is life-like," urged
Rosanette.</p>

<p>"Pooh! what do I care about a thing being life-like?
Down with Realism! 'Tis the spirit that must
be portrayed by the painter! Let me alone! I am
going to try to conjure up what it ought to be!"</p>

<p>He reflected, with his left hand clasping his brow,
and with his right hand clutching his elbow; then,
all of a sudden:</p>

<p>"Ha, I have an idea! a pastel! With coloured
mezzotints, almost spread out flat, a lovely model
could be obtained with the outer surface alone!"</p>

<p>He sent the chambermaid to look for his box of
colours; then, having a chair under his feet and another
by his side, he began to throw out great
touches with as much complacency as if he had
drawn them in accordance with the bust. He praised
the little Saint John of Correggio, the Infanta Rosa of
Velasquez, the milk-white flesh-tints of Reynolds, the
distinction of Lawrence, and especially the child with
long hair that sits in Lady Gower's lap.</p>

<p>"Besides, could you find anything more charming
than these little toads? The type of the sublime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
(Raphael has proved it by his Madonnas) is probably
a mother with her child?"</p>

<p>Rosanette, who felt herself stifling, went away;
and presently Pellerin said:</p>

<p>"Well, about Arnoux; you know what has happened?"</p>

<p>"No! What?"</p>

<p>"However, it was bound to end that way!"</p>

<p>"What has happened, might I ask?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps by this time he is&mdash;&mdash;Excuse me!"</p>

<p>The artist got up in order to raise the head of the
little corpse higher.</p>

<p>"You were saying&mdash;&mdash;" Frederick resumed.</p>

<p>And Pellerin, half-closing his eyes, in order to take
his dimensions better:</p>

<p>"I was saying that our friend Arnoux is perhaps
by this time locked up!"</p>

<p>Then, in a tone of satisfaction:</p>

<p>"Just give a little glance at it. Is that the thing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, 'tis quite right. But about Arnoux?"</p>

<p>Pellerin laid down his pencil.</p>

<p>"As far as I could understand, he was sued by
one Mignot, an intimate friend of Regimbart&mdash;a long-headed
fellow that, eh? What an idiot! Just imagine!
one day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! it's not Regimbart that's in question, is it?"</p>

<p>"It is, indeed! Well, yesterday evening, Arnoux
had to produce twelve thousand francs; if not, he was
a ruined man."</p>

<p>"Oh! this perhaps is exaggerated," said Frederick.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. It looked to me a very serious business,
very serious!"</p>

<p>At that moment Rosanette reappeared, with red
spots under her eyes, which glowed like dabs of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
paint. She sat down near the drawing and gazed at
it. Pellerin made a sign to the other to hold his
tongue on account of her. But Frederick, without
minding her:</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I can't believe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you I met him yesterday," said the artist,
"at seven o'clock in the evening, in the Rue Jacob.
He had even taken the precaution to have his passport
with him; and he spoke about embarking from
Havre, he and his whole camp."</p>

<p>"What! with his wife?"</p>

<p>"No doubt. He is too much of a family man to
live by himself."</p>

<p>"And are you sure of this?"</p>

<p>"Certain, faith! Where do you expect him to
find twelve thousand francs?"</p>

<p>Frederick took two or three turns round the room.
He panted for breath, bit his lips, and then snatched
up his hat.</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?" said Rosanette.</p>

<p>He made no reply, and the next moment he had
disappeared.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="chapter_xviii" id="chapter_xviii"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">An Auction.</h3>


<p><img src="images/i_chxviii.png" width="125" height="121" alt="T" title="" class="illodrop" style="margin-top: -3.5em;" />welve thousand francs should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
procured, or, if not, he would see
Madame Arnoux no more; and until
now there had lingered in his
breast an unconquerable hope. Did
she not, as it were, constitute the
very substance of his heart, the very basis of his
life? For some minutes he went staggering along
the footpath, his mind tortured with anxiety, and
nevertheless gladdened by the thought that he was
no longer by the other's side.</p>

<p>Where was he to get the money? Frederick was
well aware from his own experience how hard it
was to obtain it immediately, no matter at what cost.
There was only one person who could help him in
the matter&mdash;Madame Dambreuse. She always kept a
good supply of bank-notes in her escritoire. He
called at her house; and in an unblushing fashion:</p>

<p>"Have you twelve thousand francs to lend me?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>That was another person's secret. She wanted to
know who this person was. He would not give way
on this point. They were equally determined not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
yield. Finally, she declared that she would give nothing
until she knew for what purpose it was wanted.</p>

<p>Frederick's face became very flushed; and he stated
that one of his comrades had committed a theft. It
was necessary to replace the sum this very day.</p>

<p>"Let me know his name? His name? Come!
what's his name?"</p>

<p>"Dussardier!"</p>

<p>And he threw himself on his knees, imploring of
her to say nothing about it.</p>

<p>"What idea have you got into your head about
me?" Madame Dambreuse replied. "One would imagine
that you were the guilty party yourself. Pray,
have done with your tragic airs! Hold on! here's the
money! and much good may it do him!"</p>

<p>He hurried off to see Arnoux. That worthy merchant
was not in his shop. But he was still residing
in the Rue de Paradis, for he had two domiciles.</p>

<p>In the Rue de Paradis, the porter said that M.
Arnoux had been away since the evening before.
As for Madame, he ventured to say nothing; and
Frederick, having rushed like an arrow up the stairs,
laid his ear against the keyhole. At length, the
door was opened. Madame had gone out with Monsieur.
The servant could not say when they would
be back; her wages had been paid, and she was
leaving herself.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard the door creaking.</p>

<p>"But is there anyone in the room?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Monsieur! it is the wind."</p>

<p>Thereupon he withdrew. There was something
inexplicable in such a rapid disappearance.</p>

<p>Regimbart, being Mignot's intimate friend, could
perhaps enlighten him? And Frederick got himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
driven to that gentleman's house at Montmartre in the
Rue l'Empereur.</p>

<p>Attached to the house there was a small garden
shut in by a grating which was stopped up with
iron plates. Three steps before the hall-door set off
the white front; and a person passing along the footpath
could see the two rooms on the ground-floor,
the first of which was a parlour with ladies' dresses
lying on the furniture on every side, and the second
the workshop in which Madame Regimbart's female
assistants were accustomed to sit.</p>

<p>They were all convinced that Monsieur had important
occupations, distinguished connections, that he
was a man altogether beyond comparison. When he
was passing through the lobby with his hat cocked
up at the sides, his long grave face, and his green
frock-coat, the girls stopped in the midst of their
work. Besides, he never failed to address to them a
few words of encouragement, some observation which
showed his ceremonious courtesy; and, afterwards, in
their own homes they felt unhappy at not having
been able to preserve him as their ideal.</p>

<p>No one, however, was so devoted to him as Madame
Regimbart, an intelligent little woman, who
maintained him by her handicraft.</p>

<p>As soon as M. Moreau had given his name, she
came out quickly to meet him, knowing through the
servants what his relations were with Madame Dambreuse.
Her husband would be back in a moment; and
Frederick, while he followed her, admired the appearance
of the house and the profusion of oil-cloth that
was displayed in it. Then he waited a few minutes
in a kind of office, into which the Citizen was in the
habit of retiring, in order to be alone with his thoughts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>When they met, Regimbart's manner was less
cranky than usual.</p>

<p>He related Arnoux's recent history. The ex-manufacturer
of earthenware had excited the vanity of
Mignot, a patriot who owned a hundred shares in
the <i>Si&egrave;cle</i>, by professing to show that it would be
necessary from the democratic standpoint to change
the management and the editorship of the newspaper;
and under the pretext of making his views prevail in
the next meeting of shareholders, he had given the
other fifty shares, telling him that he could pass them
on to reliable friends who would back up his vote.
Mignot would have no personal responsibility, and
need not annoy himself about anyone; then, when he
had achieved success, he would be able to secure a
good place in the administration of at least from five
to six thousand francs. The shares had been delivered.
But Arnoux had at once sold them, and with
the money had entered into partnership with a dealer
in religious articles. Thereupon came complaints from
Mignot, to which Arnoux sent evasive answers. At
last the patriot had threatened to bring against him
a charge of cheating if he did not restore his share-certificates
or pay an equivalent sum&mdash;fifty thousand
francs.</p>

<p>Frederick's face wore a look of despondency.</p>

<p>"That is not the whole of it," said the Citizen.
"Mignot, who is an honest fellow, has reduced his
claim to one fourth. New promises on the part of
the other, and, of course, new dodges. In short, on
the morning of the day before yesterday Mignot sent
him a written application to pay up, within twenty-four
hours, twelve thousand francs, without prejudice
to the balance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I have the amount!" said Frederick.</p>

<p>The Citizen slowly turned round:</p>

<p>"Humbug!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me! I have the money in my pocket.
I brought it with me."</p>

<p>"How you do go at it! By Jove, you do! However,
'tis too late now&mdash;the complaint has been
lodged, and Arnoux is gone."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"No! along with his wife. They were seen at
the Havre terminus."</p>

<p>Frederick grew exceedingly pale. Madame Regimbart
thought he was going to faint. He regained his
self-possession with an effort, and had even sufficient
presence of mind to ask two or three questions about
the occurrence. Regimbart was grieved at the affair,
considering that it would injure the cause of Democracy.
Arnoux had always been lax in his conduct
and disorderly in his life.</p>

<p>"A regular hare-brained fellow! He burned the
candle at both ends! The petticoat has ruined him!
'Tis not himself that I pity, but his poor wife!" For
the Citizen admired virtuous women, and had a great
esteem for Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>"She must have suffered a nice lot!"</p>

<p>Frederick felt grateful to him for his sympathy;
and, as if Regimbart had done him a service, pressed
his hand effusively.</p>

<p>"Have you done all that's necessary in the matter?"
was Rosanette's greeting to him when she saw
him again.</p>

<p>He had not been able to pluck up courage to do
it, he answered, and walked about the streets at random
to divert his thoughts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>At eight o'clock, they passed into the dining-room;
but they remained seated face to face in silence,
gave vent each to a deep sigh every now and then,
and pushed away their plates.</p>

<p>Frederick drank some brandy. He felt quite shattered,
crushed, annihilated, no longer conscious of anything
save a sensation of extreme fatigue.</p>

<p>She went to look at the portrait. The red, the
yellow, the green, and the indigo made glaring stains
that jarred with each other, so that it looked a hideous
thing&mdash;almost ridiculous.</p>

<p>Besides, the dead child was now unrecognisable.
The purple hue of his lips made the whiteness of his
skin more remarkable. His nostrils were more drawn
than before, his eyes more hollow; and his head
rested on a pillow of blue taffeta, surrounded by petals
of camelias, autumn roses, and violets. This was
an idea suggested by the chambermaid, and both of
them had thus with pious care arranged the little
corpse. The mantelpiece, covered with a cloth of
guipure, supported silver-gilt candlesticks with bunches
of consecrated box in the spaces between them. At
the corners there were a pair of vases in which pastilles
were burning. All these things, taken in conjunction
with the cradle, presented the aspect of an
altar; and Frederick recalled to mind the night when
he had watched beside M. Dambreuse's death-bed.</p>

<p>Nearly every quarter of an hour Rosanette drew
aside the curtains in order to take a look at her child.
She saw him in imagination, a few months hence,
beginning to walk; then at college, in the middle of
the recreation-ground, playing a game of base; then
at twenty years a full-grown young man; and all
these pictures conjured up by her brain created for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
her, as it were, the son she would have lost, had he
only lived, the excess of her grief intensifying in her
the maternal instinct.</p>

<p>Frederick, sitting motionless in another armchair,
was thinking of Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>No doubt she was at that moment in a train, with
her face leaning against a carriage window, while she
watched the country disappearing behind her in the
direction of Paris, or else on the deck of a steamboat,
as on the occasion when they first met; but this vessel
carried her away into distant countries, from which
she would never return. He next saw her in a room
at an inn, with trunks covering the floor, the wall-paper
hanging in shreds, and the door shaking in the
wind. And after that&mdash;to what would she be compelled
to turn? Would she have to become a school-mistress
or a lady's companion, or perhaps a
chambermaid? She was exposed to all the vicissitudes
of poverty. His utter ignorance as to what her
fate might be tortured his mind. He ought either to
have opposed her departure or to have followed her.
Was he not her real husband? And as the thought
impressed itself on his consciousness that he would
never meet her again, that it was all over forever,
that she was lost to him beyond recall, he felt, so to
speak, a rending of his entire being, and the tears
that had been gathering since morning in his heart
overflowed.</p>

<p>Rosanette noticed the tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are crying just like me! You are grieving,
too?"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pressed her to his heart, and they both sobbed,
locked in each other's arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse was weeping too, as she lay,
face downwards, on her bed, with her hands clasped
over her head.</p>

<p>Olympe Regimbart having come that evening to
try on her first coloured gown after mourning, had
told her about Frederick's visit, and even about the
twelve thousand francs which he had ready to transfer
to M. Arnoux.</p>

<p>So, then, this money, the very money which he
had got from her, was intended to be used simply for
the purpose of preventing the other from leaving Paris&mdash;for
the purpose, in fact, of preserving a mistress!</p>

<p>At first, she broke into a violent rage, and determined
to drive him from her door, as she would have
driven a lackey. A copious flow of tears produced a
soothing effect upon her. It was better to keep it all
to herself, and say nothing about it.</p>

<p>Frederick brought her back the twelve thousand
francs on the following day.</p>

<p>She begged of him to keep the money lest he might
require it for his friend, and she asked a number of
questions about this gentleman. Who, then, had
tempted him to such a breach of trust? A woman,
no doubt! Women drag you into every kind of
crime.</p>

<p>This bantering tone put Frederick out of countenance.
He felt deep remorse for the calumny he had
invented. He was reassured by the reflection that
Madame Dambreuse could not be aware of the facts.
All the same, she was very persistent about the subject;
for, two days later, she again made enquiries
about his young friend, and, after that, about another&mdash;Deslauriers.</p>

<p>"Is this young man trustworthy and intelligent?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick spoke highly of him.</p>

<p>"Ask him to call on me one of these mornings;
I want to consult him about a matter of business."</p>

<p>She had found a roll of old papers in which there
were some bills of Arnoux, which had been duly protested,
and which had been signed by Madame
Arnoux. It was about these very bills Frederick had
called on M. Dambreuse on one occasion while the
latter was at breakfast; and, although the capitalist
had not sought to enforce repayment of this outstanding
debt, he had not only got judgment on foot of
them from the Tribunal of Commerce against Arnoux,
but also against his wife, who knew nothing about
the matter, as her husband had not thought fit to give
her any information on the point.</p>

<p>Here was a weapon placed in Madame Dambreuse's
hands&mdash;she had no doubt about it. But her notary
would advise her to take no step in the affair. She
would have preferred to act through some obscure
person, and she thought of that big fellow with such
an impudent expression of face, who had offered her
his services.</p>

<p>Frederick ingenuously performed this commission
for her.</p>

<p>The advocate was enchanted at the idea of having
business relations with such an aristocratic lady.</p>

<p>He hurried to Madame Dambreuse's house.</p>

<p>She informed him that the inheritance belonged to
her niece, a further reason for liquidating those debts
which she should repay, her object being to overwhelm
Martinon's wife by a display of greater attention
to the deceased's affairs.</p>

<p>Deslauriers guessed that there was some hidden
design underlying all this. He reflected while he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
examining the bills. Madame Arnoux's name, traced
by her own hand, brought once more before his eyes
her entire person, and the insult which he had received
at her hands. Since vengeance was offered to
him, why should he not snatch at it?</p>

<p>He accordingly advised Madame Dambreuse to
have the bad debts which went with the inheritance
sold by auction. A man of straw, whose name
would not be divulged, would buy them up, and
would exercise the legal rights thus given him to
realise them. He would take it on himself to provide
a man to discharge this function.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the month of November, Frederick,
happening to pass through the street in which
Madame Arnoux had lived, raised his eyes towards
the windows of her house, and saw posted on the
door a placard on which was printed in large letters:</p>

<p>"Sale of valuable furniture, consisting of kitchen
utensils, body and table linen, shirts and chemises,
lace, petticoats, trousers, French and Indian cashmeres,
an Erard piano, two Renaissance oak chests, Venetian
mirrors, Chinese and Japanese pottery."</p>

<p>"'Tis their furniture!" said Frederick to himself,
and his suspicions were confirmed by the doorkeeper.</p>

<p>As for the person who had given instructions for
the sale, he could get no information on that head.
But perhaps the auctioneer, Ma&icirc;tre Berthelmot, might
be able to throw light on the subject.</p>

<p>The functionary did not at first want to tell what
creditor was having the sale carried out. Frederick
pressed him on the point. It was a gentleman named
S&eacute;n&eacute;cal, an agent; and Ma&icirc;tre Berthelmot even carried
his politeness so far as to lend his newspaper&mdash;the
<i>Petites Affiches</i>&mdash;to Frederick.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter, on reaching Rosanette's house, flung
down this paper on the table spread wide open.</p>

<p>"Read that!"</p>

<p>"Well, what?" said she with a face so calm that
it roused up in him a feeling of revolt.</p>

<p>"Ah! keep up that air of innocence!"</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you mean."</p>

<p>"'Tis you who are selling out Madame Arnoux
yourself!"</p>

<p>She read over the announcement again.</p>

<p>"Where is her name?"</p>

<p>"Oh! 'tis her furniture. You know that as well
as I do."</p>

<p>"What does that signify to me?" said Rosanette,
shrugging her shoulders.</p>

<p>"What does it signify to you? But you are taking
your revenge, that's all. This is the consequence
of your persecutions. Haven't you outraged her so far
as to call at her house?&mdash;you, a worthless creature!
and this to the most saintly, the most charming, the
best woman that ever lived! Why do you set your
heart on ruining her?"</p>

<p>"I assure you, you are mistaken!"</p>

<p>"Come now! As if you had not put S&eacute;n&eacute;cal forward
to do this!"</p>

<p>"What nonsense!"</p>

<p>Then he was carried away with rage.</p>

<p>"You lie! you lie! you wretch! You are jealous of
her! You have got a judgment against her husband!
S&eacute;n&eacute;cal is already mixed up in your affairs. He detests
Arnoux; and your two hatreds have entered into
a combination with one another. I saw how delighted
he was when you won that action of yours about the
kaolin shares. Are you going to deny this?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>"I give you my word&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know what that's worth&mdash;your word!"</p>

<p>And Frederick reminded her of her lovers, giving
their names and circumstantial details. Rosanette
drew back, all the colour fading from her face.</p>

<p>"You are astonished at this. You thought I was
blind because I shut my eyes. Now I have had
enough of it. We do not die through the treacheries
of a woman of your sort. When they become too
monstrous we get out of the way. To inflict punishment
on account of them would be only to degrade
oneself."</p>

<p>She twisted her arms about.</p>

<p>"My God, who can it be that has changed him?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but yourself."</p>

<p>"And all this for Madame Arnoux!" exclaimed
Rosanette, weeping.</p>

<p>He replied coldly:</p>

<p>"I have never loved any woman but her!"</p>

<p>At this insult her tears ceased to flow.</p>

<p>"That shows your good taste! A woman of mature
years, with a complexion like liquorice, a thick
waist, big eyes like the ventholes of a cellar, and just
as empty! As you like her so much, go and join
her!"</p>

<p>"This is just what I expected. Thank you!"</p>

<p>Rosanette remained motionless, stupefied by this
extraordinary behaviour.</p>

<p>She even allowed the door to be shut; then, with
a bound, she pulled him back into the anteroom,
and flinging her arms around him:</p>

<p>"Why, you are mad! you are mad! this is absurd!
I love you!" Then she changed her tone to one of
entreaty:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good heavens! for the sake of our dead infant!"</p>

<p>"Confess that it was you who did this trick!"
said Frederick.</p>

<p>She still protested that she was innocent.</p>

<p>"You will not acknowledge it?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, farewell! and forever!"</p>

<p>"Listen to me!"</p>

<p>Frederick turned round:</p>

<p>"If you understood me better, you would know
that my decision is irrevocable!"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! you will come back to me again!"</p>

<p>"Never as long as I live!"</p>

<p>And he slammed the door behind him violently.</p>

<p>Rosanette wrote to Deslauriers saying that she
wanted to see him at once.</p>

<p>He called one evening, about five days later; and,
when she told him about the rupture:</p>

<p>"That's all! A nice piece of bad luck!"</p>

<p>She thought at first that he would have been able
to bring back Frederick; but now all was lost. She
ascertained through the doorkeeper that he was about
to be married to Madame Dambreuse.</p>

<p>Deslauriers gave her a lecture, and showed himself
an exceedingly gay fellow, quite a jolly dog; and,
as it was very late, asked permission to pass the
night in an armchair.</p>

<p>Then, next morning, he set out again for Nogent,
informing her that he was unable to say when they
would meet once more. In a little while, there would
perhaps be a great change in his life.</p>

<p>Two hours after his return, the town was in a
state of revolution. The news went round that M.
Frederick was going to marry Madame Dambreuse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
At length the three Mesdemoiselles Auger, unable to
stand it any longer, made their way to the house of
Madame Moreau, who with an air of pride confirmed
this intelligence. P&egrave;re Roque became quite ill when
he heard it. Louise locked herself up; it was even
rumoured that she had gone mad.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Frederick was unable to hide his dejection.
Madame Dambreuse, in order to divert his
mind, no doubt, from gloomy thoughts, redoubled
her attentions. Every afternoon they went out for a
drive in her carriage; and, on one occasion, as they
were passing along the Place de la Bourse, she took
the idea into her head to pay a visit to the public
auction-rooms for the sake of amusement.</p>

<p>It was the 1st of December, the very day on which
the sale of Madame Arnoux's furniture was to take
place. He remembered the date, and manifested his
repugnance, declaring that this place was intolerable
on account of the crush and the noise. She only
wanted to get a peep at it. The brougham drew up.
He had no alternative but to accompany her.</p>

<p>In the open space could be seen washhand-stands
without basins, the wooden portions of armchairs, old
hampers, pieces of porcelain, empty bottles, mattresses;
and men in blouses or in dirty frock-coats, all grey
with dust, and mean-looking faces, some with canvas
sacks over their shoulders, were chatting in separate
groups or hailing each other in a disorderly fashion.</p>

<p>Frederick urged that it was inconvenient to go on
any further.</p>

<p>"Pooh!"</p>

<p>And they ascended the stairs. In the first room,
at the right, gentlemen, with catalogues in their hands,
were examining pictures; in another, a collection of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Chinese weapons were being sold. Madame Dambreuse
wanted to go down again. She looked at the
numbers over the doors, and she led him to the end
of the corridor towards an apartment which was
blocked up with people.</p>

<p>He immediately recognised the two whatnots belonging
to the office of <i>L'Art Industriel</i>, her work-table,
all her furniture. Heaped up at the end of the
room according to their respective heights, they formed
a long slope from the floor to the windows, and at
the other sides of the apartment, the carpets and the
curtains hung down straight along the walls. There
were underneath steps occupied by old men who had
fallen asleep. At the left rose a sort of counter at
which the auctioneer, in a white cravat, was lightly
swinging a little hammer. By his side a young man
was writing, and below him stood a sturdy fellow,
between a commercial traveller and a vendor of countermarks,
crying out: "Furniture for sale." Three
attendants placed the articles on a table, at the sides
of which sat in a row second-hand dealers and old-clothes'
women. The general public at the auction
kept walking in a circle behind them.</p>

<p>When Frederick came in, the petticoats, the neckerchiefs,
and even the chemises were being passed on
from hand to hand, and then given back. Sometimes
they were flung some distance, and suddenly strips
of whiteness went flying through the air. After that
her gowns were sold, and then one of her hats, the
broken feather of which was hanging down, then her
furs, and then three pairs of boots; and the disposal
by sale of these relics, wherein he could trace in a
confused sort of way the very outlines of her form,
appeared to him an atrocity, as if he had seen carrion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
crows mangling her corpse. The atmosphere of the
room, heavy with so many breaths, made him feel sick.
Madame Dambreuse offered him her smelling-bottle.
She said that she found all this highly amusing.</p>

<p>The bedroom furniture was now exhibited. Ma&icirc;tre
Berthelmot named a price. The crier immediately repeated
it in a louder voice, and the three auctioneer's
assistants quietly waited for the stroke of the hammer,
and then carried off the article sold to an adjoining
apartment. In this way disappeared, one after
the other, the large blue carpet spangled with camellias,
which her dainty feet used to touch so lightly
as she advanced to meet him, the little upholstered
easy-chair, in which he used to sit facing her when
they were alone together, the two screens belonging
to the mantelpiece, the ivory of which had been rendered
smoother by the touch of her hands, and a
velvet pincushion, which was still bristling with pins.
It was as if portions of his heart had been carried
away with these things; and the monotony of the
same voices and the same gestures benumbed him with
fatigue, and caused within him a mournful torpor, a
sensation like that of death itself.</p>

<p>There was a rustle of silk close to his ear. Rosanette
touched him.</p>

<p>It was through Frederick himself that she had
learned about this auction. When her first feelings of
vexation was over, the idea of deriving profit from it
occurred to her mind. She had come to see it in a
white satin vest with pearl buttons, a furbelowed
gown, tight-fitting gloves on her hands, and a look
of triumph on her face.</p>

<p>He grew pale with anger. She stared at the
woman who was by his side.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse had recognised her, and for a
minute they examined each other from head to foot
minutely, in order to discover the defect, the blemish&mdash;the
one perhaps envying the other's youth, and
the other filled with spite at the extreme good form,
the aristocratic simplicity of her rival.</p>

<p>At last Madame Dambreuse turned her head
round with a smile of inexpressible insolence.</p>

<p>The crier had opened a piano&mdash;her piano! While
he remained standing before it he ran the fingers of
his right hand over the keys, and put up the instrument
at twelve hundred francs; then he brought down
the figures to one thousand, then to eight hundred,
and finally to seven hundred.</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse, in a playful tone, laughed
at the appearance of some socket that was out of
gear.</p>

<p>The next thing placed before the second-hand
dealers was a little chest with medallions and silver
corners and clasps, the same one which he had seen
at the first dinner in the Rue de Choiseul, which had
subsequently been in Rosanette's house, and again
transferred back to Madame Arnoux's residence. Often,
during their conversations his eyes wandered towards
it. He was bound to it by the dearest memories,
and his soul was melting with tender emotions about
it, when suddenly Madame Dambreuse said:</p>

<p>"Look here! I am going to buy that!"</p>

<p>"But it is not a very rare article," he returned.</p>

<p>She considered it, on the contrary, very pretty, and
the appraiser commended its delicacy.</p>

<p>"A gem of the Renaissance! Eight hundred
francs, messieurs! Almost entirely of silver! With
a little whiting it can be made to shine brilliantly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>And, as she was pushing forward through the
crush of people:</p>

<p>"What an odd idea!" said Frederick.</p>

<p>"You are annoyed at this!"</p>

<p>"No! But what can be done with a fancy article
of that sort?"</p>

<p>"Who knows? Love-letters might be kept in it,
perhaps!"</p>

<p>She gave him a look which made the allusion
very clear.</p>

<p>"A reason the more for not robbing the dead of
their secrets."</p>

<p>"I did not imagine she was dead." And then in
a loud voice she went on to bid:</p>

<p>"Eight hundred and eighty francs!"</p>

<p>"What you're doing is not right," murmured
Frederick.</p>

<p>She began to laugh.</p>

<p>"But this is the first favour, dear, that I am asking
from you."</p>

<p>"Come, now! doesn't it strike you that at this
rate you won't be a very considerate husband?"</p>

<p>Some one had just at that moment made a higher
bid.</p>

<p>"Nine hundred francs!"</p>

<p>"Nine hundred francs!" repeated Ma&icirc;tre Berthelmot.</p>

<p>"Nine hundred and ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash;twenty&mdash;thirty!"
squeaked the auctioneer's crier, with jerky shakes of
his head as he cast a sweeping glance at those assembled
around him.</p>

<p>"Show me that I am going to have a wife who
is amenable to reason," said Frederick.</p>

<p>And he gently drew her towards the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>The auctioneer proceeded:</p>

<p>"Come, come, messieurs; nine hundred and thirty.
Is there any bidder at nine hundred and thirty?"</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse, just as she had reached the
door, stopped, and raising her voice to a high pitch:</p>

<p>"One thousand francs!"</p>

<p>There was a thrill of astonishment, and then a
dead silence.</p>

<p>"A thousand francs, messieurs, a thousand francs!
Is nobody advancing on this bid? Is that clear? Very
well, then&mdash;one thousand francs! going!&mdash;gone!"</p>

<p>And down came the ivory hammer. She passed
in her card, and the little chest was handed over to
her. She thrust it into her muff.</p>

<p>Frederick felt a great chill penetrating his heart.</p>

<p>Madame Dambreuse had not let go her hold of his
arm; and she had not the courage to look up at his
face in the street, where her carriage was awaiting her.</p>

<p>She flung herself into it, like a thief flying away
after a robbery, and then turned towards Frederick.
He had his hat in his hand.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to come in?"</p>

<p>"No, Madame!"</p>

<p>And, bowing to her frigidly, he shut the carriage-door,
and then made a sign to the coachman to drive
away.</p>

<p>The first feeling that he experienced was one of
joy at having regained his independence. He was
filled with pride at the thought that he had avenged
Madame Arnoux by sacrificing a fortune to her; then,
he was amazed at his own act, and he felt doubled
up with extreme physical exhaustion.</p>

<p>Next morning his man-servant brought him the
news.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>The city had been declared to be in a state of
siege; the Assembly had been dissolved; and a number
of the representatives of the people had been imprisoned
at Mazas. Public affairs had assumed to his
mind an utterly unimportant aspect, so deeply preoccupied
was he by his private troubles.</p>

<p>He wrote to several tradesmen countermanding
various orders which he had given for the purchase of
articles in connection with his projected marriage,
which now appeared to him in the light of a rather
mean speculation; and he execrated Madame Dambreuse,
because, owing to her, he had been very near
perpetrating a vile action. He had forgotten the Mar&eacute;chale,
and did not even bother himself about Madame
Arnoux&mdash;absorbed only in one thought&mdash;lost
amid the wreck of his dreams, sick at heart, full of
grief and disappointment, and in his hatred of the
artificial atmosphere wherein he had suffered so much,
he longed for the freshness of green fields, the repose
of provincial life, a sleeping existence spent beneath
his natal roof in the midst of ingenuous hearts. At
last, when Wednesday evening arrived, he made his
way out into the open air.</p>

<p>On the boulevard numerous groups had taken up
their stand. From time to time a patrol came and
dispersed them; they gathered together again in regular
order behind it. They talked freely and in loud
tones, made chaffing remarks about the soldiers,
without anything further happening.</p>

<p>"What! are they not going to fight?" said Frederick
to a workman.</p>

<p>"They're not such fools as to get themselves killed
for the well-off people! Let them take care of themselves!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>And a gentleman muttered, as he glanced across
at the inhabitants of the faubourgs:</p>

<p>"Socialist rascals! If it were only possible, this
time, to exterminate them!"</p>

<p>Frederick could not, for the life of him, understand
the necessity of so much rancour and vituperative
language. His feeling of disgust against Paris was intensified
by these occurrences, and two days later he
set out for Nogent by the first train.</p>

<p>The houses soon became lost to view; the country
stretched out before his gaze. Alone in his carriage,
with his feet on the seat in front of him, he pondered
over the events of the last few days, and then on his
entire past. The recollection of Louise came back to
his mind.</p>

<p>"She, indeed, loved me truly! I was wrong not
to snatch at this chance of happiness. Pooh! let us
not think any more about it!"</p>

<p>Then, five minutes afterwards: "Who knows,
after all? Why not, later?"</p>

<p>His reverie, like his eyes, wandered afar towards
vague horizons.</p>

<p>"She was artless, a peasant girl, almost a savage;
but so good!"</p>

<p>In proportion as he drew nearer to Nogent, her
image drew closer to him. As they were passing
through the meadows of Sourdun, he saw her once
more in imagination under the poplar-trees, as in the
old days, cutting rushes on the edges of the pools.
And now they had reached their destination; he
stepped out of the train.</p>

<p>Then he leaned with his elbows on the bridge, to
gaze again at the isle and the garden where they had
walked together one sunshiny day, and the dizzy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
sensation caused by travelling, together with the
weakness engendered by his recent emotions, arousing
in his breast a sort of exaltation, he said to himself:</p>

<p>"She has gone out, perhaps; suppose I were to
go and meet her!"</p>

<p>The bell of Saint-Laurent was ringing, and in the
square in front of the church there was a crowd of
poor people around an open carriage, the only one in
the district&mdash;the one which was always hired for
weddings. And all of a sudden, under the church-gate,
accompanied by a number of well-dressed persons
in white cravats, a newly-married couple appeared.</p>

<p>He thought he must be labouring under some hallucination.
But no! It was, indeed, Louise! covered
with a white veil which flowed from her red hair
down to her heels; and with her was no other than
Deslauriers, attired in a blue coat embroidered with
silver&mdash;the costume of a prefect.</p>

<p>How was this?</p>

<p>Frederick concealed himself at the corner of a
house to let the procession pass.</p>

<p>Shamefaced, vanquished, crushed, he retraced his
steps to the railway-station, and returned to Paris.</p>

<p>The cabman who drove him assured him that the
barricades were erected from the Ch&acirc;teau d'Eau to
the Gymnase, and turned down the Faubourg Saint-Martin.
At the corner of the Rue de Provence, Frederick
stepped out in order to reach the boulevards.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock. A thin shower was falling.
A number of citizens blocked up the footpath close
to the Opera House. The houses opposite were
closed. No one at any of the windows. All along
the boulevard, dragoons were galloping behind a row<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of wagons, leaning with drawn swords over their
horses; and the plumes of their helmets, and their
large white cloaks, rising up behind them, could be
seen under the glare of the gas-lamps, which shook
in the wind in the midst of a haze. The crowd
gazed at them mute with fear.</p>

<p>In the intervals between the cavalry-charges,
squads of policemen arrived on the scene to keep
back the people in the streets.</p>

<p>But on the steps of Tortoni, a man&mdash;Dussardier&mdash;who
could be distinguished at a distance by his great
height, remained standing as motionless as a caryatide.</p>

<p>One of the police-officers, marching at the head
of his men, with his three-cornered hat drawn over
his eyes, threatened him with his sword.</p>

<p>The other thereupon took one step forward, and
shouted:</p>

<p>"Long live the Republic!"</p>

<p>The next moment he fell on his back with his
arms crossed.</p>

<p>A yell of horror arose from the crowd. The
police-officer, with a look of command, made a circle
around him; and Frederick, gazing at him in open-mouthed
astonishment, recognised S&eacute;n&eacute;cal.</p>

<p>He realised the melancholy associated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
with packet-boats, the chill
one feels on waking up under
tents, the dizzy effect of landscapes
and ruins, and the bitterness
of ruptured sympathies.</p>

<p>He returned home.</p>

<p>He mingled in society, and he conceived attachments
to other women. But the constant recollection
of his first love made these appear insipid; and besides
the vehemence of desire, the bloom of the sensation
had vanished. In like manner, his intellectual
ambitions had grown weaker. Years passed; and he
was forced to support the burthen of a life in which
his mind was unoccupied and his heart devoid of
energy.</p>

<p>Towards the end of March, 1867, just as it was
getting dark, one evening, he was sitting all alone in
his study, when a woman suddenly came in.</p>

<p>"Madame Arnoux!"</p>

<p>"Frederick!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>She caught hold of his hands, and drew him
gently towards the window, and, as she gazed into
his face, she kept repeating:</p>

<p>"'Tis he! Yes, indeed&mdash;'tis he!"</p>

<p>In the growing shadows of the twilight, he could
see only her eyes under the black lace veil that hid
her face.</p>

<p>When she had laid down on the edge of the
mantelpiece a little pocket-book bound in garnet
velvet, she seated herself in front of him, and they
both remained silent, unable to utter a word, smiling
at one another.</p>

<p>At last he asked her a number of questions about
herself and her husband.</p>

<p>They had gone to live in a remote part of Brittany
for the sake of economy, so as to be able to pay
their debts. Arnoux, now almost a chronic invalid,
seemed to have become quite an old man. Her
daughter had been married and was living at Bordeaux,
and her son was in garrison at Mostaganem.</p>

<p>Then she raised her head to look at him again:</p>

<p>"But I see you once more! I am happy!"</p>

<p>He did not fail to let her know that, as soon as he
heard of their misfortune, he had hastened to their
house.</p>

<p>"I was fully aware of it!"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>She had seen him in the street outside the house,
and had hidden herself.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>Then, in a trembling voice, and with long pauses
between her words:</p>

<p>"I was afraid! Yes&mdash;afraid of you and of myself!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>This disclosure gave him, as it were, a shock of
voluptuous joy. His heart began to throb wildly.
She went on:</p>

<p>"Excuse me for not having come sooner." And,
pointing towards the little pocket-book covered with
golden palm-branches:</p>

<p>"I embroidered it on your account expressly. It
contains the amount for which the Belleville property
was given as security."</p>

<p>Frederick thanked her for letting him have the
money, while chiding her at the same time for having
given herself any trouble about it.</p>

<p>"No! 'tis not for this I came! I was determined to
pay you this visit&mdash;then I would go back there again."</p>

<p>And she spoke about the place where they had
taken up their abode.</p>

<p>It was a low-built house of only one story; and
there was a garden attached to it full of huge box-trees,
and a double avenue of chestnut-trees, reaching
up to the top of the hill, from which there was a
view of the sea.</p>

<p>"I go there and sit down on a bench, which I
have called 'Frederick's bench.'"</p>

<p>Then she proceeded to fix her gaze on the furniture,
the objects of virt&ugrave;, the pictures, with eager intentness,
so that she might be able to carry away the
impressions of them in her memory. The Mar&eacute;chale's
portrait was half-hidden behind a curtain. But the
gilding and the white spaces of the picture, which
showed their outlines through the midst of the surrounding
darkness, attracted her attention.</p>

<p>"It seems to me I knew that woman?"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Frederick. "It is an old Italian
painting."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>She confessed that she would like to take a walk
through the streets on his arm.</p>

<p>They went out.</p>

<p>The light from the shop-windows fell, every now
and then, on her pale profile; then once more she
was wrapped in shadow, and in the midst of the
carriages, the crowd, and the din, they walked on
without paying any heed to what was happening
around them, without hearing anything, like those
who make their way across the fields over beds of
dead leaves.</p>

<p>They talked about the days which they had formerly
spent in each other's society, the dinners at
the time when <i>L'Art Industriel</i> flourished, Arnoux's
fads, his habit of drawing up the ends of his collar
and of squeezing cosmetic over his moustache, and
other matters of a more intimate and serious character.
What delight he experienced on the first occasion
when he heard her singing! How lovely she looked
on her feast-day at Saint-Cloud! He recalled to her
memory the little garden at Auteuil, evenings at the
theatre, a chance meeting on the boulevard, and some
of her old servants, including the negress.</p>

<p>She was astonished at his vivid recollection of
these things.</p>

<p>"Sometimes your words come back to me like a
distant echo, like the sound of a bell carried on by
the wind, and when I read passages about love in
books, it seems to me that it is about you I am
reading."</p>

<p>"All that people have found fault with as exaggerated
in fiction you have made me feel," said
Frederick. "I can understand Werther, who felt no
disgust at his Charlotte for eating bread and butter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor, dear friend!"</p>

<p>She heaved a sigh; and, after a prolonged silence:</p>

<p>"No matter; we shall have loved each other truly!"</p>

<p>"And still without having ever belonged to each
other!"</p>

<p>"This perhaps is all the better," she replied.</p>

<p>"No, no! What happiness we might have enjoyed!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure of it with a love like yours!"</p>

<p>And it must have been very strong to endure after
such a long separation.</p>

<p>Frederick wished to know from her how she first
discovered that he loved her.</p>

<p>"It was when you kissed my wrist one evening
between the glove and the cuff. I said to myself,
'Ah! yes, he loves me&mdash;he loves me;' nevertheless,
I was afraid of being assured of it. So charming was
your reserve, that I felt myself the object, as it were,
of an involuntary and continuous homage."</p>

<p>He regretted nothing now. He was compensated
for all he had suffered in the past.</p>

<p>When they came back to the house, Madame Arnoux
took off her bonnet. The lamp, placed on a
bracket, threw its light on her white hair. Frederick
felt as if some one had given him a blow in the middle
of the chest.</p>

<p>In order to conceal from her his sense of disillusion,
he flung himself on the floor at her feet, and seizing
her hands, began to whisper in her ear words of tenderness:</p>

<p>"Your person, your slightest movements, seemed
to me to have a more than human importance in
the world. My heart was like dust under your feet.
You produced on me the effect of moonlight on a
summer's night, when around us we find nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
but perfumes, soft shadows, gleams of whiteness, infinity;
and all the delights of the flesh and of the
spirit were for me embodied in your name, which I
kept repeating to myself while I tried to kiss it with
my lips. I thought of nothing further. It was Madame
Arnoux such as you were with your two
children, tender, grave, dazzlingly beautiful, and yet
so good! This image effaced every other. Did I not
think of it alone? for I had always in the very depths
of my soul the music of your voice and the brightness
of your eyes!"</p>

<p>She accepted with transports of joy these tributes
of adoration to the woman whom she could no longer
claim to be. Frederick, becoming intoxicated with
his own words, came to believe himself in the reality
of what he said. Madame Arnoux, with her back
turned to the light of the lamp, stooped towards him.
He felt the caress of her breath on his forehead, and
the undefined touch of her entire body through the
garments that kept them apart. Their hands were
clasped; the tip of her boot peeped out from beneath
her gown, and he said to her, as if ready to faint:</p>

<p>"The sight of your foot makes me lose my self-possession."</p>

<p>An impulse of modesty made her rise. Then, without
any further movement, she said, with the strange
intonation of a somnambulist:</p>

<p>"At my age!&mdash;he&mdash;Frederick! Ah! no woman
has ever been loved as I have been. No! Where is
the use in being young? What do I care about them,
indeed? I despise them&mdash;all those women who come
here!"</p>

<p>"Oh! very few women come to this place," he
returned, in a complaisant fashion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Her face brightened up, and then she asked him
whether he meant to be married.</p>

<p>He swore that he never would.</p>

<p>"Are you perfectly sure? Why should you not?"</p>

<p>"'Tis on your account!" said Frederick, clasping
her in his arms.</p>

<p>She remained thus pressed to his heart, with her
head thrown back, her lips parted, and her eyes
raised. Suddenly she pushed him away from her
with a look of despair, and when he implored of her
to say something to him in reply, she bent forward
and whispered:</p>

<p>"I would have liked to make you happy!"</p>

<p>Frederick had a suspicion that Madame Arnoux
had come to offer herself to him, and once more he
was seized with a desire to possess her&mdash;stronger,
fiercer, more desperate than he had ever experienced
before. And yet he felt, the next moment, an unaccountable
repugnance to the thought of such a thing,
and, as it were, a dread of incurring the guilt of incest.
Another fear, too, had a different effect on him&mdash;lest
disgust might afterwards take possession of
him. Besides, how embarrassing it would be!&mdash;and,
abandoning the idea, partly through prudence, and
partly through a resolve not to degrade his ideal, he
turned on his heel and proceeded to roll a cigarette
between his fingers.</p>

<p>She watched him with admiration.</p>

<p>"How dainty you are! There is no one like you!
There is no one like you!"</p>

<p>It struck eleven.</p>

<p>"Already!" she exclaimed; "at a quarter-past I
must go."</p>

<p>She sat down again, but she kept looking at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
clock, and he walked up and down the room, puffing
at his cigarette. Neither of them could think of anything
further to say to the other. There is a moment
at the hour of parting when the person that we love
is with us no longer.</p>

<p>At last, when the hands of the clock got past the
twenty-five minutes, she slowly took up her bonnet,
holding it by the strings.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my friend&mdash;my dear friend! I shall
never see you again! This is the closing page in
my life as a woman. My soul shall remain with you
even when you see me no more. May all the blessings
of Heaven be yours!"</p>

<p>And she kissed him on the forehead, like a mother.</p>

<p>But she appeared to be looking for something, and
then she asked him for a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>She unfastened her comb, and all her white hair
fell down.</p>

<p>With an abrupt movement of the scissors, she cut
off a long lock from the roots.</p>

<p>"Keep it! Good-bye!"</p>

<p>When she was gone, Frederick rushed to the
window and threw it open. There on the footpath
he saw Madame Arnoux beckoning towards a passing
cab. She stepped into it. The vehicle disappeared.</p>

<p>And this was all.</p>

<h3 class="chapter2">"Wait Till You Come to Forty Year."</h3>


<p><img src="images/i_chxx.png" width="126" height="125" alt="A" title="" class="illodrop" style="margin-top: -3em;" />bout the beginning of this winter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Frederick and Deslauriers were chatting
by the fireside, once more
reconciled by the fatality of their
nature, which made them always
reunite and be friends again.</p>

<p>Frederick briefly explained his quarrel with Madame
Dambreuse, who had married again, her second
husband being an Englishman.</p>

<p>Deslauriers, without telling how he had come to
marry Mademoiselle Roque, related to his friend how
his wife had one day eloped with a singer. In order
to wipe away to some extent the ridicule that this
brought upon him, he had compromised himself by
an excess of governmental zeal in the exercise of his
functions as prefect. He had been dismissed. After
that, he had been an agent for colonisation in Algeria,
secretary to a pasha, editor of a newspaper, and canvasser
for advertisements, his latest employment being
the office of settling disputed cases for a manufacturing
company.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Frederick, having squandered two thirds of
his means, he was now living like a citizen of comparatively
humble rank.</p>

<p>Then they questioned each other about their
friends.</p>

<p>Martinon was now a member of the Senate.</p>

<p>Hussonnet occupied a high position, in which he
was fortunate enough to have all the theatres and entire
press dependent upon him.</p>

<p>Cisy, given up to religion, and the father of eight
children, was living in the ch&acirc;teau of his ancestors.</p>

<p>Pellerin, after turning his hand to Fourri&egrave;rism,
hom&oelig;opathy, table-turning, Gothic art, and humanitarian
painting, had become a photographer; and he
was to be seen on every dead wall in Paris, where
he was represented in a black coat with a very small
body and a big head.</p>

<p>"And what about your chum S&eacute;n&eacute;cal?" asked
Frederick.</p>

<p>"Disappeared&mdash;I can't tell you where! And yourself&mdash;what
about the woman you were so passionately
attached to, Madame Arnoux?"</p>

<p>"She is probably at Rome with her son, a lieutenant
of chasseurs."</p>

<p>"And her husband?"</p>

<p>"He died a year ago."</p>

<p>"You don't say so?" exclaimed the advocate.
Then, striking his forehead:</p>

<p>"Now that I think of it, the other day in a shop
I met that worthy Mar&eacute;chale, holding by the hand a
little boy whom she has adopted. She is the widow
of a certain M. Oudry, and is now enormously stout.
What a change for the worse!&mdash;she who formerly
had such a slender waist!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>Deslauriers did not deny that he had taken advantage
of the other's despair to assure himself of that
fact by personal experience.</p>

<p>"As you gave me permission, however."</p>

<p>This avowal was a compensation for the silence
he had maintained with reference to his attempt with
Madame Arnoux.</p>

<p>Frederick would have forgiven him, inasmuch as he
had not succeeded in the attempt.</p>

<p>Although a little annoyed at the discovery, he pretended
to laugh at it; and the allusion to the Mar&eacute;chale
brought back the Vatnaz to his recollection.</p>

<p>Deslauriers had never seen her any more than the
others who used to come to the Arnoux's house; but
he remembered Regimbart perfectly.</p>

<p>"Is he still living?"</p>

<p>"He is barely alive. Every evening regularly he
drags himself from the Rue de Grammont to the Rue
Montmartre, to the caf&eacute;s, enfeebled, bent in two, emaciated,
a spectre!"</p>

<p>"Well, and what about Compain?"</p>

<p>Frederick uttered a cry of joy, and begged of the
ex-delegate of the provisional government to explain
to him the mystery of the calf's head.</p>

<p>"'Tis an English importation. In order to parody
the ceremony which the Royalists celebrated on the
thirtieth of January, some Independents founded an
annual banquet, at which they have been accustomed
to eat calves' heads, and at which they make it their
business to drink red wine out of calves' skulls while
giving toasts in favour of the extermination of the
Stuarts. After Thermidor, the Terrorists organised a
brotherhood of a similar description, which proves
how prolific folly is."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"You seem to me very dispassionate about politics?"</p>

<p>"Effect of age," said the advocate.</p>

<p>And then they each proceeded to summarise their
lives.</p>

<p>They had both failed in their objects&mdash;the one
who dreamed only of love, and the other of power.</p>

<p>What was the reason of this?</p>

<p>"'Tis perhaps from not having taken up the proper
line," said Frederick.</p>

<p>"In your case that may be so. I, on the contrary,
have sinned through excess of rectitude, without
taking into account a thousand secondary things
more important than any. I had too much logic, and
you too much sentiment."</p>

<p>Then they blamed luck, circumstances, the epoch
at which they were born.</p>

<p>Frederick went on:</p>

<p>"We have never done what we thought of doing
long ago at Sens, when you wished to write a critical
history of Philosophy and I a great medi&aelig;val romance
about Nogent, the subject of which I had found in
Froissart: 'How Messire Brokars de Fenestranges and
the Archbishop of Troyes attacked Messire Eustache
d'Ambrecicourt.' Do you remember?"</p>

<p>And, exhuming their youth with every sentence,
they said to each other:</p>

<p>"Do you remember?"</p>

<p>They saw once more the college playground, the
chapel, the parlour, the fencing-school at the bottom
of the staircase, the faces of the ushers and of the pupils&mdash;one
named Angelmare, from Versailles, who
used to cut off trousers-straps from old boots, M.
Mirbal and his red whiskers, the two professors of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
linear drawing and large drawing, who were always
wrangling, and the Pole, the fellow-countryman of
Copernicus, with his planetary system on pasteboard,
an itinerant astronomer whose lecture had been paid
for by a dinner in the refectory, then a terrible debauch
while they were out on a walking excursion,
the first pipes they had smoked, the distribution of
prizes, and the delightful sensation of going home for
the holidays.</p>

<p>It was during the vacation of 1837 that they had
called at the house of the Turkish woman.</p>

<p>This was the phrase used to designate a woman
whose real name was Zoraide Turc; and many persons
believed her to be a Mohammedan, a Turk,
which added to the poetic character of her establishment,
situated at the water's edge behind the rampart.
Even in the middle of summer there was a shadow
around her house, which could be recognised by a
glass bowl of goldfish near a pot of mignonette at a
window. Young ladies in white nightdresses, with
painted cheeks and long earrings, used to tap at the
panes as the students passed; and as it grew dark,
their custom was to hum softly in their hoarse voices
at the doorsteps.</p>

<p>This home of perdition spread its fantastic notoriety
over all the arrondissement. Allusions were made
to it in a circumlocutory style: "The place you
know&mdash;a certain street&mdash;at the bottom of the
Bridges." It made the farmers' wives of the district
tremble for their husbands, and the ladies grow apprehensive
as to their servants' virtue, inasmuch as
the sub-prefect's cook had been caught there; and, to
be sure, it exercised a fascination over the minds of
all the young lads of the place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, one Sunday, during vesper-time, Frederick
and Deslauriers, having previously curled their hair,
gathered some flowers in Madame Moreau's garden,
then made their way out through the gate leading
into the fields, and, after taking a wide sweep round
the vineyards, came back through the Fishery, and
stole into the Turkish woman's house with their big
bouquets still in their hands.</p>

<p>Frederick presented his as a lover does to his betrothed.
But the great heat, the fear of the unknown,
and even the very pleasure of seeing at one glance
so many women placed at his disposal, excited him
so strangely that he turned exceedingly pale, and remained
there without advancing a single step or
uttering a single word. All the girls burst out laughing,
amused at his embarrassment. Fancying that
they were turning him into ridicule, he ran away;
and, as Frederick had the money, Deslauriers was
obliged to follow him.</p>

<p>They were seen leaving the house; and the episode
furnished material for a bit of local gossip which was
not forgotten three years later.</p>

<p>They related the story to each other in a prolix
fashion, each supplementing the narrative where the
other's memory failed; and, when they had finished
the recital:</p>

<p>"That was the best time we ever had!" said
Frederick.</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps so, indeed! It was the best time
we ever had," said Deslauriers.</p>
